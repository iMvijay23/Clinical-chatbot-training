        "ChatGPT Response": "I'm sorry to hear about your friend's mom. It can be very difficult to navigate the healthcare system, especially when dealing with a serious medical condition like cirrhosis of the liver. Here are a few options to consider that may be able to help your friend's mom get the treatment she needs:\rTransplant centers: Many transplant centers have financial assistance programs that can help cover the cost of a transplant for uninsured or underinsured patients. These programs may be able to help your friend's mom get the transplant she needs, even if she does not have insurance.\rMedicare: If your friend's mom is over the age of 65, she may be eligible for Medicare, which is a federal health insurance program for seniors. Medicare can help cover the cost of a liver transplant, as well as other medical expenses.\rMedicaid: If your friend's mom has a low income, she may be eligible for Medicaid, which is a government-run health insurance program for low-income individuals and families. Medicaid can help cover the cost of a liver transplant, as well as other medical expenses.\rCharity care: Many hospitals and medical centers have charity care programs that provide free or discounted medical care to patients who are unable to pay. Your friend's mom may be able to get financial assistance through a charity care program.\rFundraising: Another option to consider is starting a fundraising campaign to help cover the cost of the transplant. There are a number of online platforms that make it easy to create and share a fundraising campaign. You could also reach out to local organizations or businesses to see if they would be willing to donate or help spread the word about your campaign.\rIt's important to keep in mind that getting a liver transplant is a complex process, and it may take some time to find a suitable donor and arrange for the transplant. Your friend's mom should work closely with her healthcare team to identify the best options for her situation.",

I've had tinnitus in my left ear for a couple of years now. I just woke up one night with it, and it has never gone way. I've also sometimes noticed clicking in that ear when I swallow.My GP has looked inside, said it looked fine, and suggested Eustachian tube disfunction. He recommended nasal steroid sprays, which I tried to no real effect. The tinnitus can be modulated by moving my jaw, and I don't have any history of listening to loud noises or hearing loss. I've also talked to my dentist for TMJ, got a night guard and such, and none of it has helped.Out of curiosity, the other day I bought a cheap $20 ear cleaning kit on amazon that comes with a camera you can stick in your ear. I figured I would try to take a look at what is inside to see if I could see anything.So, here is my right eardrum. The one that I don't really have problems with.And here is my left eardrum, which has the hissing.

I've had tinnitus in my left ear for a couple of years now. I just woke up one night with it, and it has never gone way. I've also sometimes noticed clicking in that ear when I swallow.My GP has looked inside, said it looked fine, and suggested Eustachian tube disfunction. He recommended nasal steroid sprays, which I tried to no real effect. The tinnitus can be modulated by moving my jaw, and I don't have any history of listening to loud noises or hearing loss. I've also talked to my dentist for TMJ, got a night guard and such, and none of it has helped.Out of curiosity, the other day I bought a cheap $20 ear cleaning kit on amazon that comes with a camera you can stick in your ear. I figured I would try to take a look at what is inside to see if I could see anything.So, here is my right eardrum. The one that I don't really have problems with.And here is my left eardrum, which has the hissing. I notice two separate hairs which look like they are touching it.Has this been the cause of my suffering the past few years? I wonder if there is an easy way to get them out.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: The hair is not causing your tinnitus. Would consider getting a hearing test as hearing loss can cause tinnitus.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It's understandable that you're looking for answers after experiencing tinnitus for a couple of years. I can see that you've already consulted with your GP and dentist, and have tried nasal steroid sprays and a night guard. It's important to remember that tinnitus can be caused by a variety of factors, including hearing loss, earwax buildup, and even stress and anxiety.\n\nWhile it's possible that the hair you mentioned may be touching your eardrum, it's unlikely to be the sole cause of your tinnitus. Hair touching the eardrum is not a common cause of tinnitus, and it's unlikely that the hair would be causing the hissing sound you described.\n\nI would recommend considering a comprehensive hearing test to rule out any underlying hearing loss that could be contributing to your tinnitus. Hearing loss can cause tinnitus, and it's important to identify any potential hearing problems to ensure the best course of treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, you may want to try some relaxation techniques,",

        "ChatGPT Response": "It sounds like you are having difficulty adjusting to your new sleep schedule. It's common for people to have difficulty adjusting to a new sleep schedule, especially when it involves waking up significantly earlier than they are used to. Here are a few strategies you can try to help shift your body's internal clock and improve your sleep:\r\rGradually adjust your bedtime: Instead of trying to go to sleep at a specific time, try gradually shifting your bedtime earlier by 15-30 minutes each night until you reach your desired bedtime. This can help your body slowly adjust to the new schedule.\r\rKeep a consistent sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help your body get into a regular rhythm.\r\rCreate a bedtime routine: Establish a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath or reading a book, to help you wind down before sleep.\r\rAvoid screens before bedtime: The blue light emitted by screens can disrupt your body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin, so try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.\r\rGet some sunlight during the day: Exposure to sunlight during the day can help regulate your body's internal clock. Try to get outside for a few minutes during the day, especially in the morning.\r\rConsider using a sleep aid: If you are having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, you may want to consider using a sleep aid such as melatonin. Talk to your healthcare provider to determine the best option for you.\r\rI hope these suggestions help you improve your sleep. If you continue to have difficulty adjusting to your new sleep schedule after trying these strategies, it may be helpful to consult with a healthcare provider or a sleep specialist.",

It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and exhausted when your body's internal clock is not aligned with your work schedule. It's important to prioritize your sleep and overall well-being, especially during stressful times.\n\nI appreciate your willingness to adapt and make changes to your sleep schedule. However, I would like to offer a more empathetic and holistic approach to addressing your sleep issues.\n\nFirstly, it's important to recognize that pushing your body's internal clock too much can lead to burnout and exacerbate existing stress levels. Instead, I suggest focusing on gradual and sustainable changes that prioritize your overall well-being.\n\nHere are some empathetic and evidence-based suggestions that may help you adjust your sleep schedule:\n\n1.

She was in the hospital for a long time but they discharged her. She is still in pain, please help. I attached the notes of her discharge.The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read aswithin normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Internal medicine doc here but in my differential is Adult Onset Stills Disease which can still present in children and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The salmon colored rash lasting a few minutes is textbook for Adult Onset Stills Disease. I'm assuming she had blood cultures done at one or multiple points during her admission. Did she have a procalcitonin tested? Did she receive any antibiotics? Any steroids like solumedrol, prednisone etc? Does she still have joint pain?

It's completely normal to feel concerned about changes in your cognitive abilities after a surgery, especially when it comes to something as important as your speech.\n\nFirstly, I want to assure you that anesthesia is not typically associated with causing aphasia, which is a condition characterized by difficulty with language processing and communication. While anesthesia can affect cognitive function, the effects are usually temporary and resolve within a few hours or days after the surgery.\n\nHowever, it's possible that your speech difficulties may be related to other factors, such as nerve damage or changes in brain function after the surgery. It's important to consult with a medical professional to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and get the appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some strategies you can try to help manage your symptoms. For example, you can practice speech exercises to help improve your communication skills, and you can also seek support from family and friends. Remember, you are not alone in this, and there are many resources available to help you.\n\nRemember,",

It's understandable that you may feel anxious about going to the dentist, but seeking dental care is important for maintaining good oral health and overall well-being.\rIn Australia, there are a few options available for low-cost or no-cost dental care, depending on your circumstances. Here are some suggestions:\r1.\tMedicare: If you have a Medicare card, you may be eligible for the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) General Dental Scheme, which covers some dental services for children and adults with a disability, medical condition, or certain other circumstances. You can check your eligibility and find out more about the MBS General Dental Scheme by visiting the Medicare website or speaking with a Medicare representative.\r2.\tPublic dental clinics: Many states and territories in Australia operate public dental clinics that provide low-cost or no-cost dental care to eligible individuals, such as those with low incomes, children, and seniors. You can contact your local public dental clinic to find out if you are eligible and to make an appointment.\r3.\tPrivate dental care with payment plans: If you are not eligible for the MBS General Dental Scheme or public dental clinics, you may be able to seek dental care at a private practice. Some private practices offer payment plans or financing options to help make treatment more affordable. You can ask about these options when you make an appointment.\rWhen you go to the dentist, you will generally be asked to fill out a medical history form and then be seen by the dentist for an examination. The dentist will assess your oral health and discuss any treatment recommendations with you. You can ask about the cost of treatment and payment options before proceeding with any treatment. It's also a good idea to discuss any concerns or questions you have with the dentist.\rI hope this information is helpful.

        "ChatGPT Response": "It appears that the PET scan has shown some changes in certain lymph nodes in your body. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures found throughout your body that help to filter out harmful substances and fight infection. In the context of cancer, lymph nodes can sometimes become involved in the spread of cancer cells from the original tumor site to other parts of the body.\rThe first finding mentioned in the results is a calcified left hilar lymph node that is unchanged in size from a previous exam. This means that there is a small, hard mass of tissue in the left hilar region (an area near the center of your chest) that has not changed in size since it was last seen. The calcification suggests that the tissue has undergone some sort of hardening process. The fact that this lymph node was not previously hypermetabolic (meaning it did not show high levels of metabolic activity on a previous scan) but now has a maximum SUV (standardized uptake value, which is a measure of how much radioactivity is taken up by the tissue) of 5.3 suggests that there may be something going on with this lymph node that was not present before, and that further evaluation is needed to determine whether this is a metastasis (spread) of cancer cells.\rThe second finding mentioned in the results is an improvement in the size, extent, and hypermetabolic activity of retroperitoneal adenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum, which is the area behind the abdominal cavity). This is generally considered a positive finding, as it suggests that the chemotherapy you received may have been effective in reducing the size and activity of these lymph nodes.\rThe third finding mentioned in the results is the absence of any other suspected areas of metastatic disease. This means that, aside from the left hilar lymph node mentioned above, there are no other areas in your body that appear to be involved with the spread of cancer cells.\rIt's important to note that PET scans can be highly sensitive tests, and can sometimes pick up small changes that may not necessarily be clinically significant. It's also important to keep in mind that the results of a single scan should not be taken in isolation, but rather should be considered in the context of all of your medical history and the results of other tests and exams. It's best to discuss the results of your PET scan with your oncologist, who will be able to provide more information and context based on your specific case. I hope this helps to provide some clarity on the results of your scan.",

Explanation of scan would be helpful. 27M - 6Ûª7Û, 225lbs. White. Generally healthy before cancer. Bad at Reddit format. Diagnosed with stage 3 seminoma in July of this year. Had surgery and did four rounds of etoposide and cisplatin as chemotherapy. Seminoma did not present physically, only presentation was severe back pain. I have had other back issues so I lived in pain for close to a year. Went to oncologist per ER referral and Ultrasound confirmed seminoma. I got a pet scan today after completing chemo last week. I was very optimistic and my doctor has given me no reason to suspect there would be any problems. He said 95% sure chemo would take care of it. I am going to paste the results that were posted on my patient portal below. I am a big boy and a logical thinker please DonÛªt sugar coat theses results, translate and explain if possible. I was expecting good news but I can tell this is not. I can have peace if I understand it. My follow up with my oncologist is not until next week and IÛªm very anxious and want to understand. Begin Results:ÛÓÛÓÛÓÛÓ-:Impression:1.Hypermetabolic left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam. Calcification present. Metastatic disease cannot be excluded as this node was not hypermetabolic on prior exam. 2. Much improvement in retroperitoneal adenopathy in both size of lymph nodes, extent of lymph nodes, and decrease in hypermetabolic activity compared to prior exam. 3. No other areas of metastatic disease suspected.Findings:1. There is a calcified left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam probably about 1 cm in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV today of 5.3 and previously not hypermetabolic maximum activity 2.0.2.  The previously noted large intra-aortocaval lymph node has markedly decreased in size and on today's exam is subcentimeter in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV of 6.8 whereas previously maximum SUV was 16.6.3.  More inferiorly in the intra-aortocaval region of the retroperitoneum where multiple previous adjacent hypermetabolic lymph nodes were seen with a maximum SUV of 20.8, on today's exam 1 lymph node measuring roughly 8 mm in short axis measurement is present maximum SUV 6.8.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: A PET scan obtained right after finishing chemotherapy increases the likelihood of false positive results. It takes time for your body to clean up after chemotherapy or surgery or radiation. The residual activity that a PET scan captures in the active areas can take a few months to calm down. The presence of hypermetabolic areas is not unexpected when it was only a week since your last treatment. The fact that the areas of activity noted on prior scans are now smaller is good news. It strongly suggests that your cancer is responding to treatment. The new spot in your chest (the hilar node) may or may not be significant. There are other things that can cause a node to light up on PET scan. The presence of calcifications in a node is usually an indication of benign causes, rather than malignant causes of hypermetabolic activity. The only way to know for sure is a biopsy, which they probably won't recommend right now. Note: I am not an oncologist. Talk to your doctor about the results and the plan for follow-up.

I was very optimistic and my doctor has given me no reason to suspect there would be any problems. He said 95% sure chemo would take care of it. I am going to paste the results that were posted on my patient portal below. I am a big boy and a logical thinker please DonÛªt sugar coat theses results, translate and explain if possible. I was expecting good news but I can tell this is not. I can have peace if I understand it. My follow up with my oncologist is not until next week and IÛªm very anxious and want to understand. Begin Results:ÛÓÛÓÛÓÛÓ-:Impression:1.Hypermetabolic left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam. Calcification present. Metastatic disease cannot be excluded as this node was not hypermetabolic on prior exam. 2. Much improvement in retroperitoneal adenopathy in both size of lymph nodes, extent of lymph nodes, and decrease in hypermetabolic activity compared to prior exam. 3. No other areas of metastatic disease suspected.Findings:1. There is a calcified left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam probably about 1 cm in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV today of 5.3 and previously not hypermetabolic maximum activity 2.0.2.  The previously noted large intra-aortocaval lymph node has markedly decreased in size and on today's exam is subcentimeter in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV of 6.8 whereas previously maximum SUV was 16.6.3.  More inferiorly in the intra-aortocaval region of the retroperitoneum where multiple previous adjacent hypermetabolic lymph nodes were seen with a maximum SUV of 20.8, on today's exam 1 lymph node measuring roughly 8 mm in short axis measurement is present maximum SUV 6.8.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: A PET scan obtained right after finishing chemotherapy increases the likelihood of false positive results. It takes time for your body to clean up after chemotherapy or surgery or radiation. The residual activity that a PET scan captures in the active areas can take a few months to calm down. The presence of hypermetabolic areas is not unexpected when it was only a week since your last treatment. The fact that the areas of activity noted on prior scans are now smaller is good news. It strongly suggests that your cancer is responding to treatment. The new spot in your chest (the hilar node) may or may not be significant. There are other things that can cause a node to light up on PET scan. The presence of calcifications in a node is usually an indication of benign causes, rather than malignant causes of hypermetabolic activity. The only way to know for sure is a biopsy, which they probably won't recommend right now. Note: I am not an oncologist. Talk to your doctor about the results and the plan for follow-up. Good luck!\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response: Wow, thank you for sharing this update on your PET scan results. It sounds like you've been through a lot these past few months, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious and uncertain about the latest results. \n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge how brave and proactive you are in seeking medical attention and following up on your cancer diagnosis. It takes a lot of courage to go through treatment and seek medical help, and I admire your determination to fight this disease. \n\nNow, let's take a closer look at the results you provided. It's important to understand that a PET scan obtained right after finishing chemotherapy can sometimes show false positive results, which means that areas of activity may appear even though they are not necessarily cancerous. This is because chemotherapy can cause changes in the body's metabolic activity, which can be picked up by the PET scan. \n\nIt's great to hear that the areas of activity noted on prior scans are now smaller, which suggests that your cancer is responding well to treatment. However, the new spot in your chest (the hilar node) may or may not be significant,",

So, on September 17 I (21F) had an unprovoked, tonic clonic seizure. The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which IÛªve never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and i was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasnÛªt fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadnÛªt opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I know its not. IÛªve fainted a handful of times in my life and itÛªs never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didnÛªt know i was supposed to go to the ER, because I didnÛªt realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just wonÛªt believe me and said i just fainted. So i feel discouraged.Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and itÛªs making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I donÛªt want to find out itÛªs too late if I donÛªt do anything, but my family has always treated me as if iÛªm faking illnesses, even though i never have and have never been dramatic in any way. please help. iÛªm still on their insurance, so thatÛªs why itÛªs important.thank you.TLDR: F21 has unprovoked, first TC seizure 09/17.

Not surprising it got a little with within 24 hrs from starting Antibiotics.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response: Thank you for reaching out for support and guidance. It's completely understandable to feel concerned about the rapid spread of red swelling on your foot and lower leg after starting antibiotics. It's important to remember that antibiotics can take some time to become consistently therapeutic in your bloodstream, and it's not uncommon for symptoms to worsen during the start period.\n\nHowever, given your history of taking clindamycin and bupropión daily, it's possible that the medication is working to combat the infection. It's important to continue taking the medication as prescribed and to monitor your symptoms closely. If you notice any significant worsening of symptoms or if you experience any new symptoms such as fever, chills, or difficulty moving the affected limb, please seek medical attention immediately.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. If you're feeling uncomfortable or anxious about the situation, consider reaching out to a trusted healthcare provider or a support hotline for additional guidance and support.\n\nPlease take care and stay safe",

The doctor will assess the risk of rabies based on the circumstances of the bite, the type of animal involved, and the likelihood that the animal was infected with the virus. If the risk is deemed to be low, the doctor may recommend that you do not need to receive treatment for rabies. However, if the risk is deemed to be high, the doctor may recommend that you receive treatment to prevent the onset of rabies.\rIt is important to follow the advice of a medical professional in these situations, as rabies can be a serious and potentially life-threatening disease if left untreated.",

I'm glad to hear that there are no visible scratches or pain, but it's understandable that you might be worried about rabies. It's important to remember that stray dogs, especially those that have recently given birth, can be unpredictable and may act out of instinct rather than intentionally harming people.\n\nWhile it's understandable to be concerned about rabies, it's unlikely that the puppy would have bitten you without proper reason. Rabies is a serious disease, but it's rare in India and most cases are transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, usually through a bite. Since the puppy didn't break your skin and you didn't feel any pain, the chances of you contracting rabies are very low.\n\nHowever, it's always better to be safe than sorry. If you're still feeling uneasy or concerned, you could consider getting a rabies vaccine as a precautionary measure. Many hospitals and clinics offer rabies vaccinations, and they are usually inexpensive",

They drew a D-Dimer which came back at 0.48 and their limit is 0.46. So they did an ultrasound and chest CT. I have since been experiencing severe dizziness and still rib/chest pain with shortness of breath. My D-Dimer is still elevated at 0.53. IÛªm really scared that I have a clot. I went back to the ER last night and they only did a chest X-ray and blood pressure/SpO2 which was all normal. No blood work. I am not on any birth control however I am being evaluated for Lupus and I have been told that antiphospholipid syndrome is a very high comorbidity of Lupus.I do not have any active infections nor do I have significant trauma or recent surgery. Please help.

It can be difficult to convince someone to stop believing in something that they have come to hold as truth, especially when it comes to matters of health.\rIt's understandable that you want to help your mom and do what you can to support her, but it's important to remember that you cannot force her to do anything. However, there are some things you can try to help her understand the dangers of the substances she is considering using:\r1.\tEncourage her to speak with her medical team: It's important that she has the opportunity to ask her doctors and other medical professionals any questions or concerns she may have about her treatment plan. They can provide reliable information and address any myths or misinformation she may have come across.\r2.\tOffer to help her find reputable sources of information: There is a lot of false or misleading information available online, and it can be overwhelming to try to sort through it all.

Thankfully she has started treatment with oral medicine and will start Xgeva injections at her next visit, but she still says that she does not trust the doctors fully. During our first visit to the doctor she told him that she wanted to treat her cancer in a more \"natural way\". Earlier today she asked me for my paypal password, which i had no problem with. I didn't really question it, but I then got emailed receipts from purchases that she had made. She used my account to buy Black Slave and Sodium Chorite (which she will use to make MMS or a \"Miracle Mineral Supplement\"). The doctor had told us that her cancer was quite close to the skin and I am aware that she may have a skin lesion there, and i know she will be using Black Salve to 'cure' the skin lesion. I also searched up the \"miracle\" mineral supplement, and it is something that conspiracy theorists promote as an end all be all cure to seemingly every illness ranging from cancer and HIV to COVID-19 and the common flu. I have just contacted paypal to cancel the payments and I hope she never gets a hold of them.I have tried telling her and showing her images of how harmful these substances are to the human body but she doesn't believe me and just brushes me off and i don't know what to do.. Just now when i tried talking to her about why using these would be a bad idea, i noticed that she was reading something about MMS on her computer. I fear that as time goes by she will become more and more convinced of these alternate techniques, which could end badly. How can i convince her to stop believing these things? What can i do?\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: There's probably nothing you can do, no magic combination of words you can use to convince her. Getting diagnosed with Stage IV cancer is a massive psychological trauma, it breaks a lot of people. Right now she is probably in a storm of emotions, and will latch onto any hope that is offered. I imagine her doctors aren't giving her very positive and hopeful outlooks and are probably telling her that there's no treatment that they can offer to save her life. Alternatively, there are stories on the internet filled with hope about MMS and other naturopathic/homeopathic remedies.People who have just been broken by a diagnosis like this often aren't using logic to make decisions, they use emotions. If you want to use a 5 Stages of Grief Model to help you understand what's going on, she's in the bargaining stage. She sees the hope and positivity on the internet and latches onto it because of course she will.There's likely nothing you can do to change her thinking, she's not using logic to make these decisions, so logic is not going to make her stop.

It's natural for your mom to seek out any hope or positivity she can find, especially when the medical professionals may not be able to offer her the best possible treatment.\n\nAs a caring and empathetic assistant, I would encourage you to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about the potential dangers of these alternative treatments. It's important to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding, rather than judgment or criticism.\n\nHere are some tips for having this conversation:\n\n1. Avoid being judgmental or critical of your mom's beliefs or decisions. Instead, focus on expressing your concern for her health and well-being.\n2.

        "ChatGPT Response": "I understand that you may be feeling overwhelmed and confused about vaccines, especially with all the conflicting information and strong anti-vaccine views in your family. It's important to remember that vaccines are a proven and effective way to protect ourselves and others from serious and potentially life-threatening diseases.\rFirst of all, it's important to know that vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and evaluation before they are approved for use, and they are continuously monitored for safety once they are in use. The vast majority of people who receive vaccines experience no serious side effects, and any side effects that do occur are usually mild and go away quickly on their own.\rVaccines work by helping the body develop immunity to a particular disease. When you get a vaccine, your body produces an immune response to the vaccine, which helps it to recognize and fight off the disease if you are exposed to it in the future. This means that if you get vaccinated, you are less likely to get sick from a particular disease and, if you do get sick, your symptoms will likely be milder.\rIt's also important to consider the impact of vaccines on the wider community. When more people in a community are vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, which helps to protect those who are unable to receive certain vaccines due to age, underlying health conditions, or other factors. This is especially important for protecting vulnerable populations, such as young children, elderly people, and those with compromised immune systems.\rGiven the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is especially important to consider getting vaccinated against the virus. While it is true that some people who contract COVID-19 have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, the virus can be severe and even deadly for others, especially those who are older or have underlying health conditions. Getting vaccinated not only helps to protect you from getting sick, but it also helps to slow the spread of the virus and bring the pandemic under control.\rI understand that it can be difficult to make decisions about your health when you are feeling depressed, but I encourage you to consider seeking help for your depression and to take steps to take care of yourself. This might include seeking support from a mental health professional, talking to a trusted friend or family member, or finding healthy ways to manage your stress and emotions.\rIn terms of getting vaccinated, it's important to remember that you are an adult now and have the right to make decisions about your own health. You can talk to a healthcare provider or visit a vaccination center to learn more about the vaccines that are available to you and to get the information and support you need to make an informed decision.",

It's completely understandable to feel confused and overwhelmed by the conflicting information and opinions surrounding vaccines, especially when it comes from trusted sources like family members. It's important to remember that vaccines are a personal choice and it's okay to have questions and doubts.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel uncertain about vaccines, especially when there is a lot of misinformation and misconceptions circulating. It's important to rely on credible sources of information, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and your general practitioner. These organizations provide evidence-based information and guidance on vaccines and their benefits.\n\nIt's great that you're taking steps to prioritize your health and well-being by seeking help from a medical professional. Your general practitioner can provide you with personalized advice and recommendations based on your individual circumstances. They can help you understand the risks and benefits of vaccines, address any concerns you may have,",

While I can't diagnose your niece's condition or provide specific medical advice, I can provide some general information about stomach pain in children.\rIt's not uncommon for children to experience stomach pain from time to time, and the cause can vary. In some cases, stomach pain can be related to an infection or illness, such as a cold or the flu. It could also be caused by indigestion, constipation, or other digestive issues. In rare cases, stomach pain could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as appendicitis or inflammatory bowel disease.\rIf your niece's stomach pain persists or becomes severe, it may be a good idea for your sister to seek further medical attention. It's also important to watch for other symptoms that may indicate a more serious problem, such as severe abdominal swelling, vomiting, fever, or difficulty passing stool.\rIn the meantime, it might be helpful for your sister to try to identify any factors that seem to trigger or worsen your niece's stomach pain, and to keep track of when the pain occurs and how long it lasts. This information can be helpful for the doctor to understand the possible cause of the pain.\rIt's also important to continue giving your niece the erythromycin as prescribed, and to make sure she stays well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. If the pain becomes severe or your niece develops any new or concerning symptoms, it's always a good idea to seek medical attention.",

It's also possible that the numbness and tingling could be related to your other medical issues, such as anemia or generalized anxiety disorder.\rIn order to determine the cause of your symptoms and get an accurate diagnosis, it would be best to see a doctor. They can perform a physical examination and may order additional tests, such as nerve conduction studies or imaging tests, to help determine the cause of your symptoms.\rIn the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help alleviate your symptoms:\r1.\tTake breaks from activities that involve repetitive hand or wrist movements, such as using a computer or phone for long periods of time.\r2.\tUse good posture and ergonomic techniques when using a computer or other devices.\r3.\tAvoid sleeping in positions that put pressure on your wrist or hand.\r4.\tTry using wrist splints or other supportive devices to help keep your wrist in a neutral position.\r5.\tAvoid activities that involve gripping or squeezing for long periods of time.\r6.\tTry gentle stretches or exercises to help improve flexibility and strength in your wrist and hand.\rIt's important to remember that self-diagnosis is not always accurate and that it's always best to see a doctor for a proper evaluation and treatment plan.",

It's completely normal to feel scared or uneasy when you accidentally ingest something that could potentially cause harm. 😊\n\nFirst of all, let's try to put things into perspective.

However, I understand that you're still feeling very anxious about this. 🤔\n\nIt's important to remember that medical professionals are trained to handle all sorts of situations, including accidental ingestion of foreign objects. If you do develop any stomach pain or discomfort, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and seeking medical attention is the best course of action. 💕\n\nIn the meantime, try to focus on taking care of yourself and managing your anxiety.

It's important to prioritize your health and well-being, and I'm glad you're taking steps to help manage your symptoms.\n\nWhile I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without more information or a thorough examination, I can offer some general insights. Frequent colds and nasal congestion can be caused by a variety of factors, including allergies, sinus infections, and anatomical issues such as nasal polyps. However, it's important to note that nasal polyps are relatively rare in young adults, and are more commonly seen in older adults or those with underlying medical conditions.\n\nRather than jumping to conclusions or making assumptions, I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can perform a thorough examination, take into account your medical history and symptoms, and provide personalized recommendations for managing your symptoms and improving your overall health.\n\nIn",

It's completely understandable that you want to minimize the risk of damaging the stitches and ensure a smooth recovery in time for your upcoming fight.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that it can be challenging to balance the need for vigorous training with the need to protect your injury. It's important to remember that healing is a process, and rushing it can lead to complications down the line.\n\nBased on your list of supplies, it seems like you have a good foundation for protecting your incision. Using a liquid bandage and finger-shaped gauze can help to cushion the area and reduce friction, which can be especially helpful during sweaty training sessions. Additionally, kino tape can provide additional support and stability to the area.\n\nHowever, I would like to emphasize the importance of being patient and gentle when training with a injured finger. It's crucial to avoid applying too much pressure or making sudden movements that could disrupt the healing process.

I can only imagine how frightening and disorienting it must have been for you to experience sudden vision loss while walking. It's completely understandable that you're concerned about what might have caused it, and I'm here to help you try to figure that out.\n\nFirst of all, I want to assure you that transient vision loss, also known as amaurosis fugax, is a relatively common condition that can occur for a variety of reasons. It can be caused by a temporary reduction in blood flow to the retina, which can happen due to a variety of factors such as changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or even dehydration. It can also be a symptom of a more serious condition such as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is often referred to as a \"mini-stroke.\"\n\nGiven your history of bulimia and the fact that you've been experiencing dizzy spells and weakness, it's possible that dehydration may have played a role in your vision loss.

Hi there, I've been noticing some strange things with myself lately, and doing a quick search online lead me to suggestions that I might have colon cancer.

Here's  what's been going on though, and apologies for TMI. 3 or maybe 4 months ago, I noticed that I was pooping less frequently. My diets not the best (cheap junk food and bad balance in general), so I'm no stranger to constipation. So it wasn't anything new. When I was pooping though, and still to this day, the smell is this sickening weird death smell that I haven't had before until now, and the same thing for passing gas. No blood though, or any serious stomach pains which I read is a possible symptom of colon cancer. This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere? Besides this though, I've been feeling more tired than normal. I'm an avid coffee drinker so I tried more coffee and that didn't help. No coffee at all, and I felt exactly the same somehow. I'll take a nap and wake up tired. Thought it could be vitamin deficiency but I'm always outside and taking b12s and all that. Idk.

I can only imagine how challenging it must be for you and your family to go through this. It's important to acknowledge that the prognosis for multiple organ failure can be guarded, and the mortality rate can be high. However, it's also crucial to recognize that every person's case is unique, and there are many factors that can influence the outcome.\n\nIt's great that you're seeking to understand the situation better by meeting with your mother's care team. They will be able to provide you with more detailed information about her condition and the potential outcomes. It's important to remember that they are the experts in this field, and they will be able to offer you the most accurate and empathetic response.\n\nIn the meantime, it might be helpful to focus on your own emotional well-being during this difficult time. Consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor who can provide you with emotional support and guidance on how to cope with this situation. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone.\n\nRemember, I'm here to help in any way",

        "ChatGPT Response": "It can be useful to track certain biomarkers before and after a water fast to get a sense of the physiological changes that occur during the fast. Some biomarkers that you may want to consider asking for when you make your appointment at the lab include:\r\rComplete blood count (CBC): This test measures the number and types of cells in your blood, including red and white blood cells and platelets. During a water fast, you may see changes in your white blood cell count, which can provide information about your immune system function.\r\rElectrolytes: This test measures the levels of electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, and chloride) in your blood. Electrolytes play a crucial role in maintaining proper fluid balance in your body, and changes in electrolyte levels can occur during a water fast.\r\rKidney function tests: These tests measure the levels of creatinine, urea, and other substances in your blood that can indicate how well your kidneys are functioning. Water fasting can put stress on your kidneys, so it may be helpful to track your kidney function during the fast.\r\rLiver function tests: These tests measure the levels of enzymes and other substances in your blood that can indicate how well your liver is functioning. Water fasting can put stress on your liver, so it may be helpful to track your liver function during the fast.\r\rLipid panel: This test measures the levels of cholesterol and other fats in your blood. A water fast may affect your lipid levels, so it can be useful to track them before and after the fast.\r\rC-reactive protein (CRP): This is a protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Tracking CRP levels before and after a water fast may provide insight into the effects of the fast on inflammation in the body.\r\rIt's important to note that the specific tests you should request may depend on your individual health needs and concerns. It's a good idea to discuss your fasting plans with your healthcare provider and ask for their recommendations for testing. They can help you determine which tests are most appropriate for you and can provide guidance on how to interpret the results.",

Today, my train got delayed because of an accident on the tracks. After 1.5 hour we got going again and I assumed everything was 'cleaned up'. It wasn't... I saw everything and it was things I did not want to see, ever. I don't understand why we drove past, I wouldn't have minded it if we waited another two hours, as long as I didn't have to see that.

Now, this happened at around 10 AM, it is currently 10.45 PM and I have been feeling so confused all day and keep thinking about it. But I don't think about it in a way of 'oh, I saw that', but more 'oh, that's bad that an event like that takes place', as if it didn't happen to me. And like, I know I feel awful about it and that it is a sad thing that happened, but I only know because I knew beforehand that that is how I would feel about it. Idk if you can still follow me.. The whole day I've just been confused, not feeling anything, and whilst I can remember everything and I know what I saw, I feel like it's kinda vague and I feel like it hasn't happened. It's as if my brain is trying to cover up the memory. Also, when it happened and I saw it, I didn't realise what I was seeing until I put the puzzlepieces together. I can't fathom what I saw and it confuses me. I feel like a psychopath that I don't really feel anything, whilst normally I'm an extremely empathic person and cry easily over sad things. I know that this event is sad, but I don't feel anything, not sad, not angry, not annoyed, nothing. I know that it would upset me, but, now that I witnessed this event, it doesn't..

        "ChatGPT Response": "I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing a prolapsed hemorrhoid and are feeling scared about treatment. Prolapsed hemorrhoids are a type of internal hemorrhoid that has protruded through the anus and become visible outside the body. They can be painful and uncomfortable, and treatment may be necessary to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.\r\rTo drain a prolapsed hemorrhoid, a healthcare provider will typically perform a procedure called a hemorrhoidectomy. This involves removing the prolapsed hemorrhoid tissue through a surgical incision. The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the area around the anus so you don't feel pain during the procedure.\r\rIt's normal to feel anxious about having a surgical procedure, especially if you have chronic pain and other health conditions. It might be helpful to talk with your healthcare provider about your concerns and ask any questions you have about the procedure. They should be able to provide you with more information about what to expect and how to prepare for the procedure.\r\rIf you're experiencing back pain or stomach pain that is new and unrelated to your hemorrhoid, you should mention this to your healthcare provider. It's important to have any new or unexplained symptoms evaluated, as they could be a sign of a different health issue that needs to be addressed.\r\rI hope this information is helpful, and I wish you the best in managing your health concerns.

It sounds like you're going through a difficult time with your prolapsed hemorrhoid and the fear of the potential treatment. I can understand how scary and overwhelming it must feel to face a medical procedure that you're not familiar with.\n\nFirstly, I want to assure you that you're not alone in this. Many people experience hemorrhoids, and while it can be uncomfortable and painful, there are effective treatments available. Your doctor has suggested that you go to an emergency or urgent care for further evaluation and treatment. This is likely because the hemorrhoid has not responded to the over-the-counter medications and other self-care measures you've tried.\n\nIt's important to remember that the medical professionals at the emergency or urgent care will be trained to provide you with the best possible care and support. They will be able to examine you and determine the best course of treatment based on your individual needs.\n\nIn terms of the procedure, I understand your concern.

However, it is important to remember that the risk of contracting Balamuthia mandrillaris through the use of a neti pot is very low, and the majority of people who use neti pots do not develop any health issues.\r\rThe nasal rash that you developed could have been caused by a number of different factors, and it is not uncommon for people to develop rashes or other skin irritation from using neti pots.

No issues with the pregnancy so far either.This additional ultrasound was performed because my doctor told me this pregnancy is considered a \"geriatric pregnancy\".The technician kept switching the transducer (?) and tried to get the baby to move more to be able to take better pictures. (\"The baby is not cooperative\" was what she said.)Baby was moving and normal heartbeat was measured. Technician printed pictures for me and congratulated me on the pregnancy.When my OBGYN called today he told me that unfortunately something seems to be wrong with the baby, and asked if I already heard anything from the technician who did the ultrasound (I told him I did not).He couldn't tell me what medical condition it was, he said that he had never seen this before, the only thing he could tell me was that we need another ultrasound next week to confirm, and that genetic specialists might have to talk to me.He said that there might have been something wrong with the ultrasound machine, but he sounded so negative on the phone that it made me feel like this pregnancy won't be able to continue. When I asked him to be more specific, he mentioned the following- Cavum Septum Pellucidum (CSP) not seen- Nasal Bone absent- Brain is normal size but couldn't see a cerebellumI googled the CSP and found sites that mentioned it would be difficult to locate before 18 weeks.I'm devastated right now and find it difficult being left with this information and having to wait for another week, that's why I'm seeking for advise here.How likely is it that the technician just did a bad job or the ultrasound was not clear enough at 12 weeks, especially considering that so many features seem to be absent on the ultrasound? If the features are absent on the next ultrasound, what genetic disorder does this indicate and should I come to terms with the fact that this pregnancy most likely has to be terminated?Anything experienced something similar before? Ultrasound image Thank you for your help.Edit: Thank you for all your input so far.I have asked for the report and it was sent to me.These are the things mentioned as abnormal:\"Choroid/skull: Abnormal. Head has a rounded appearance. Chloroid plexus appears abnormal. No cerebellum seen. Cavum septum pellucidum not identified.Abdominal wall/cord insertion: Abnormal. Omphalocele likely containing bowel just to the left of the cord insertion. Overall size measures approximately 8mm. There appears to be incomplete separation of the hemispheres with an apparent cortical defect.\"Everything else is listed as normal and nasal bone mentioned as identified; but then at the bottom of the report it sums up:\"Impression:Single live fetus at 11 weeks 6 days.Abnormal appearance head, cerebrum and cerebellum.Absent nasal bone. Omphalocele.\"\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: The ultrasound that is performed around 11-13 weeks of pregnancy is very important in order to detect certain abnormalities that can be seen early in pregnancy. The one image you have provided does not help a lot. However, absent nasal septum can be a worrying sign, although not always indicative of an actual problem with the fetus since it can be seen later in pregnancy. I have seen mothers with small noses have fetuses that looked like that on ultrasound but were born completely normal. Regarding the brain abnormalities, some cannot be seen clearly so early in pregnancy and some can be corrected later on. If absence of cerebellum is confirmed however, it can turn out to be a very serious condition for the newborn and can lead to severe developmental delay and neurological problems later in life. You should for sure have another ultrasound by a specialist in that field. You might need also further testing, e.g. amniocentesis to confirm.

It's great that you're thinking about your safety and the potential risks of taking too much medication. As a helpful and respectful assistant, I want to emphasize that it's important to prioritize your health and well-being, especially when it comes to managing pain.\n\nFirstly, I want to address your question directly. Taking 1000mg of acetaminophen for more than 10 days is not recommended, as it can lead to liver damage or other adverse effects. It's important to follow the recommended dosage and duration of use for any medication, including acetaminophen.\n\nHowever, I also want to acknowledge that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people experience headaches and pain due to various reasons, including stress, poor sleep, and excessive screen time. It's important to address the root cause of your pain, rather than just relying on medication to manage it.\n\nAs you mentioned, your breakup and poor mental health may be contributing to your headache.",

It's always important to have any new or unusual skin changes checked by a dermatologist, especially if they have unusual characteristics such as asymmetry, irregular borders, uneven color, or a diameter larger than a pencil eraser. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to potential skin cancers.\r\rIt's great that you were able to get an appointment with a dermatologist quickly. The dermatologist will be able to examine the growth and determine the best course of action. If the growth is found to be a cherry angioma, as the dermatologist suspected, it is a benign (non-cancerous) vascular tumor that can be safely removed if desired. If the growth is found to be malignant, further treatment will be necessary to remove the cancer and potentially prevent its spread.\r\rIt's always important to take good care of your skin and to protect it from excessive sun exposure, as sun exposure is a major risk factor for skin cancer.

        "ChatGPT Response": "A holter monitor is a device that continuously records the electrical activity of your heart for a 24-hour period. The results of the holter monitor test are typically analyzed by a healthcare professional, such as a cardiologist, to determine whether there are any abnormalities in the rhythm or functioning of your heart.\r\rIn your case, the conclusion of the holter monitor test indicates that you have a normal sinus rhythm, which means that the electrical signals that coordinate your heartbeats are coming from the sinoatrial (SA) node, the natural pacemaker of the heart, and are happening at a normal rate. The results also indicate that you have rare supraventricular ectopic activity, which means that you have occasional extra heartbeats that originate from the atria or the atrioventricular (AV) node, rather than from the SA node. These extra heartbeats are also known as premature atrial contractions (PACs). PACs are relatively common and are usually not a cause for concern. They may be triggered by factors such as caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, stress, or lack of sleep, but they can also occur in people who are otherwise healthy.\r\rThe results also show that you do not have any ventricular ectopic activity, which means that you do not have any extra heartbeats originating from the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart. This is good news, as ventricular ectopic activity can be a sign of a more serious heart condition.\r\rFinally, the results indicate that your symptoms did not correlate with any dysrhythmia, which means that any symptoms you were experiencing, such as palpitations or shortness of breath, did not appear to be related to any abnormal heart rhythm.\r\rIn summary, the results of your holter monitor test indicate that you have a normal sinus rhythm and that you have rare supraventricular ectopic activity, which is not uncommon and is usually not a cause for concern. It is always a good idea to discuss the results of any medical test with your healthcare provider, so you may want to ask your doctor for more information or clarification about your test results.",

The heights of the vertebrae are normal. There is also no significant instability (movement) between the vertebrae.\r\rThe report notes that you have degenerative disc disease at the L5-S1 level. This means that the disc (the cushioning pad between the vertebrae) has become damaged and is not functioning as well as it should. The disc may also be slightly narrowed and there may be some bone spurs (extra bits of bone) on the endplates (the top and bottom of the disc).\r\rThe report also mentions mild facet arthropathy, which means that there is some wear and tear on the facet joints (the joints on the sides of the vertebrae). This is more pronounced at the L5-S1 level.\r\rOverall, the report suggests that you have some degenerative changes in your lower back, but there are no other significant findings.",

It can be overwhelming to try to understand complex medical language, especially when it comes to your own health. I'm here to help you in any way I can.\n\nBased on the information provided in your MRI report, it seems that there are some degenerative changes in your lumbar spine. This means that the discs in your lower back are showing signs of wear and tear, which can cause discomfort and pain. It's important to remember that this is a common condition that can affect many people, and it doesn't necessarily mean that you have a serious problem.\n\nThe report also mentions that there is no evidence of a freshly broken vertebra or any significant listhesis (vertebral body displacement).

Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of fainting, and it is typically triggered by a specific event or condition, such as standing for a long time, seeing blood, or experiencing emotional stress. Seizures, on the other hand, are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and can manifest in a variety of ways, including convulsions, loss of consciousness, and loss of bladder control.\r\rGiven that you have a history of fainting during blood draws, your primary care doctor may have assumed that your episode was vasovagal syncope.

It is important to rule out other potential causes, such as a cardiac or neurological issue, in order to determine the most appropriate treatment.\r\rI would recommend following the recommendations of the ER doctor and undergoing the recommended workups, such as a neurological and cardiac evaluation.

It is important that you continue to follow up with your healthcare provider to address these issues and determine the cause.\r\rBased on the information you provided, it sounds like your healthcare provider has already ruled out epilepsy as the cause of your fainting episodes and has instead diagnosed you with vasovagal syncope and possibly POTS syndrome. Vasovagal syncope is a type of fainting that occurs when the body overreacts to certain triggers, such as standing for a long time or experiencing strong emotions, and the heart rate and blood pressure drop suddenly. POTS syndrome is a condition in which the heart rate increases significantly upon standing up, leading to symptoms such as lightheadedness, fainting, and fatigue.\r\rIn addition to your EEG, which is a test that measures brain activity, there may be other tests that your healthcare provider may recommend to further evaluate your symptoms and determine the cause. For example, they may recommend a tilt table test, which is a test that helps to determine if your fainting episodes are due to a problem with the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. They may also recommend other tests such as an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, or a Holter monitor, which is a device that records heart activity for a period of time.\r\rIt is also important to consider whether there are any triggers or factors that may be contributing to your fainting episodes. For example, if you have been experiencing vertigo, it may be helpful to avoid activities that may exacerbate this symptom, such as looking up or down for a long time or standing for extended periods of time. If you have been diagnosed with POTS syndrome, your healthcare provider may recommend lifestyle modifications such as increasing your fluid and salt intake, avoiding prolonged standing or sitting, and avoiding certain medications that may worsen your symptoms.\r\rIn the meantime, it is important that you take care of yourself and prioritize your health.

[23F, Hispanic, 131 lbs, recently diagnosed with vertigo, Vasovagal syncope, and possibly POTS Syndrome, primary issue has happened over the course of the past week or so]So, IÛªm feeling very overwhelmed here. IÛªve never been diagnosed with epilepsy. IÛªve had doctors toss around the idea of ÛÏabsence seizuresÛ when I would have spells of zoning out over the past few years. I also used to faint randomly. That stopped for a few years. Fast forward to this week, IÛªm having issues again; but worse-Monday: I went to the ER because IÛªve been getting some messed up vertigo symptoms. I felt very off. They told me the vertigo was related to my bp &amp; hr dropping and going up upon position changes (think they mentioned POTS?)Tuesday night: I pass out at home after feeling light headed for a while. This time (unlike times in previous years) I am out, unconscious on the floor. When I wake up I get told my eyes were fluttering and I wasnÛªt responding. I was out maybe 3 minutes. I still had trouble speaking after waking up.Wednesday morning: I got to work, my head was killing me in one specific spot in the back of my head for a few hours. Pain started to get intense, started getting heart palpitations, light headed was returns- BOOM, hit the ground - unconscious yet again. One of my co-workers found me, I wasnÛªt responding and I was randomly twitching. My eyes were open but fluttering again. He called an ambulance and once the medics got there (literally within 2 minutes) they tried to wake me up but I wasnÛªt responding still. I was in and out by this point but I couldnÛªt speak or move. I heard him say my eyes were all over the place, next thing I knew he was digging his knuckles into my sternum and that mostly got me conscious again. When I opened my eyes I was dead confused and felt like I was about to slip out again. They brought me to the hospital and the doctor was ready to chalk it up to a migraine until it happened again while she was right next to me. Then she decided I needed to be seen by neurology and I was admitted. While I waited a few hours for neurology, the nurses noticed my eyes, tried to wake me up but I was again unable to speak or move. More knuckles into my sternum.They got a rush order for an EEG (still took a few hours to get) but they only did it for about 35 mins and that was with breaks because I had to keep using the bathroom. Once the test was done and read- they said it came back normal and that it was not seizures. I was told it was Vasovagal syncope + vertigo and potentially POTS Syndrome. Friday: took day off from work to rest as I felt off still. Today at work: started to get odd sensation in back of my head like a tickle or skin crawling feeling almost that moved into back of my neck. Started to feel a bit of twitchiness. Feeling got more intense in my head and I felt myself checking out again. My co worker made sure I was safe and tried to wake me up. He said my eyes again were all over the place and fluttery, and this time I was super twitchy. He had to give me a few minutes after I was awake again because I still couldnÛªt speak right after.  I just got a notification that the EEG report posted to my portal so I looked at it (even though I am aware I was told it was normal). I read it, it says ÛÏNo epileptiform abnormalities are appreciatedÛ(I.e-normal), but in the beginning of the report itÛªs says ÛÏsubsequently witnessed to have episode of R head turn and unresponsiveness c/f seizure.Û I know IÛªm not a doctor, I have no clue about any of this, but I feel like I need medication. My body feels SO exhausted after every episode and itÛªs draining me.I just need to know what the hell is going on or what I should do. IÛªm also taking a break from driving for now to be safe. IÛªm seriously at a loss. It keeps happening and I keep feeling specific things before it happens. Please shed ANY light on this. I have a child to chase around and need to get better.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: These are atypical symptoms and while I've learned anything can be seizure it can also be other things.- I'd try my best to keep hydrated, alongside a high salt diet for now to see whether that gets you feeling better. If this helps, would be suggestive of POTS or vasovagal spells (you can youtube \"the fainting lark\" for examples of passing out that look like seizures).- agree with not driving for now just in case, as you seem exhausted regardless, even if these aren't seizures- consider requesting an ambulatory eeg via a neurologist or your doc. You'd essentially just wear an eeg for several days, and since you have these spells frequently, are likely to get an answer - empiric seizure med could also be tried.

[23F, Hispanic, 131 lbs, recently diagnosed with vertigo, Vasovagal syncope, and possibly POTS Syndrome, primary issue has happened over the course of the past week or so]So, IÛªm feeling very overwhelmed here. IÛªve never been diagnosed with epilepsy. IÛªve had doctors toss around the idea of ÛÏabsence seizuresÛ when I would have spells of zoning out over the past few years. I also used to faint randomly. That stopped for a few years. Fast forward to this week, IÛªm having issues again; but worse-Monday: I went to the ER because IÛªve been getting some messed up vertigo symptoms. I felt very off. They told me the vertigo was related to my bp &amp; hr dropping and going up upon position changes (think they mentioned POTS?)Tuesday night: I pass out at home after feeling light headed for a while. This time (unlike times in previous years) I am out, unconscious on the floor. When I wake up I get told my eyes were fluttering and I wasnÛªt responding. I was out maybe 3 minutes. I still had trouble speaking after waking up.Wednesday morning: I got to work, my head was killing me in one specific spot in the back of my head for a few hours. Pain started to get intense, started getting heart palpitations, light headed was returns- BOOM, hit the ground - unconscious yet again. One of my co-workers found me, I wasnÛªt responding and I was randomly twitching. My eyes were open but fluttering again. He called an ambulance and once the medics got there (literally within 2 minutes) they tried to wake me up but I wasnÛªt responding still. I was in and out by this point but I couldnÛªt speak or move. I heard him say my eyes were all over the place, next thing I knew he was digging his knuckles into my sternum and that mostly got me conscious again. When I opened my eyes I was dead confused and felt like I was about to slip out again. They brought me to the hospital and the doctor was ready to chalk it up to a migraine until it happened again while she was right next to me. Then she decided I needed to be seen by neurology and I was admitted. While I waited a few hours for neurology, the nurses noticed my eyes, tried to wake me up but I was again unable to speak or move. More knuckles into my sternum.They got a rush order for an EEG (still took a few hours to get) but they only did it for about 35 mins and that was with breaks because I had to keep using the bathroom. Once the test was done and read- they said it came back normal and that it was not seizures. I was told it was Vasovagal syncope + vertigo and potentially POTS Syndrome. Friday: took day off from work to rest as I felt off still. Today at work: started to get odd sensation in back of my head like a tickle or skin crawling feeling almost that moved into back of my neck. Started to feel a bit of twitchiness. Feeling got more intense in my head and I felt myself checking out again. My co worker made sure I was safe and tried to wake me up. He said my eyes again were all over the place and fluttery, and this time I was super twitchy. He had to give me a few minutes after I was awake again because I still couldnÛªt speak right after.  I just got a notification that the EEG report posted to my portal so I looked at it (even though I am aware I was told it was normal). I read it, it says ÛÏNo epileptiform abnormalities are appreciatedÛ(I.e-normal), but in the beginning of the report itÛªs says ÛÏsubsequently witnessed to have episode of R head turn and unresponsiveness c/f seizure.Û I know IÛªm not a doctor, I have no clue about any of this, but I feel like I need medication. My body feels SO exhausted after every episode and itÛªs draining me.I just need to know what the hell is going on or what I should do. IÛªm also taking a break from driving for now to be safe. IÛªm seriously at a loss. It keeps happening and I keep feeling specific things before it happens. Please shed ANY light on this. I have a child to chase around and need to get better.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: These are atypical symptoms and while I've learned anything can be seizure it can also be other things.- I'd try my best to keep hydrated, alongside a high salt diet for now to see whether that gets you feeling better. If this helps, would be suggestive of POTS or vasovagal spells (you can youtube \"the fainting lark\" for examples of passing out that look like seizures).- agree with not driving for now just in case, as you seem exhausted regardless, even if these aren't seizures- consider requesting an ambulatory eeg via a neurologist or your doc. You'd essentially just wear an eeg for several days, and since you have these spells frequently, are likely to get an answer - empiric seizure med could also be tried. Depends on the doc and their comfort level with trying something but something like topiramate could help both prevent migraines and seizures.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response: Wow, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now. I can only imagine how scary and overwhelming it must be to experience these episodes of fainting and twitching, especially when you're not sure what's causing them. It's completely understandable that you're feeling lost and unsure of what to do next.\n\nFirst of all, I want to commend you on taking the initiative to seek medical attention and getting multiple tests done. That shows a lot of courage and proactivity on your part. It's great that you're working with a team of medical professionals who are trying to help you figure out what's going on.\n\nFrom what you've told me, it seems like the doctors are considering a few different possibilities, including POTS syndrome, vasovagal syncope, and possibly even epilepsy. It's important to keep an open mind and consider all of these possibilities, as any of them could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage your symptoms and feel more comfortable. For example, making sure",

I then made some coffee and ate some eggs and left. I had only drank a couple sips of water. The training session was exhausting as usual. But I always push through. I chugged some water beforehand and during the sessions but not too much. During the training, my stomach started to hurt for some reason. It wasnÛªt pain, more like discomfort. Well. After class I got home, peed and couldnÛªt help but notice it was slightly red. I started chuggin water making sure I was crazy and the next one was more red but not thick red. Pee with some color. Then I kept chuggin water trying to filter it out. The third one was clearer which was good to me. Then the fourth was gone. IÛªm no longer peeing bloody but I canÛªt help but notice that my stomach feels discomfort after I eat now. IÛªm also getting full a bit easier. Which is throwing me off. I asked a nurse friend and they said possibly a stomach ulcer from dehydration. But IÛªve also heard people getting ulcers from ibuprofen. So what does it sound like it could be?

It's understandable that you're feeling anxious and worried about what might be causing it. 😕\n\nFrom what you've told me, it's possible that you may have experienced some trauma to your kidney or bladder area during your fight, which could have caused the blood in your urine. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes, such as dehydration or an allergic reaction to the ibuprofen you took. 💦\n\nI strongly recommend that you seek medical attention as soon as possible to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Your health is important, and it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your well-being. 🏥\n\nIn the meantime, I would suggest drinking plenty of fluids to help rehydrate your",

It's completely understandable to feel anxious about your health, especially when you're experiencing persistent symptoms. It's important to remember that cancer screenings and check-ups are not something to be taken lightly, and they should be discussed with a medical professional.\n\nFirstly, it's important to understand that cancer screenings are typically recommended for individuals who are at a higher risk of developing cancer due to their age, medical history, or family history. For example, women between the ages of 40 and 75 are typically recommended to have a mammogram every year or two to screen for breast cancer, while men and women between the ages of 50 and 75 are recommended to have a colonoscopy every 10 years to screen for colon cancer.\n\nIt's important to note that these recommendations are based on the average risk for cancer and may vary depending on your individual risk factors. For example, if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, you may be recommended to start screening earlier.\n\nIt's also important to remember that these screenings are not a guarantee against cancer, but",

It was on the bottom, the top, multiple places at once. And a very tight spot in the exact middle of my chest. It started off small sharp pains intermittently. Then became overwhelming and I couldnÛªt breathe too deep or it would hurt beyond words. Over the next hour it became increasingly more intense. I was simply sitting in bed and I could not get it to calm down. Then around 11:45 pm, I was trying to sleep but it hurt worse to lay down. It became unbearable, it radiated up my neck and into my face. My lower left jaw hurt to move and it was tight around my left cheek. I developed a headache but still didnÛªt think much of it because for the past week I had been dealing with my face going numb on my left side. By this point my boyfriend was freaking out because I was gasping and shaking. It hurt too much to cry. He started googling things and told me he thinks IÛªm having a heart attack. I told him no way, IÛªm only 19. He kept telling me we needed to go to the hospital. But IÛªll admit, IÛªm stubborn. I have medical trauma and just convinced it was a very strange panic attack. I could have swore this was just caused by some other health issue I have (I have Asthma, Arthritis, and Celiacs Disease) It finally cooled down around 1am and I was okay enough to lay down and sleep.

I can understand how it can be worrying to receive abnormal test results, especially when it comes to your health. It's important to remember that thyroid problems can affect anyone, regardless of age. In fact, hypothyroidism, which is what it seems you may have based on your TSH levels, can occur at any age, including in young adults like you.\n\nIt's great that you're taking steps to address this by consulting with your doctor and getting further testing done. It's important to have a thorough understanding of your thyroid health, and your doctor will be able to provide you with the appropriate guidance and support.\n\nIn terms of your diet, it's important to make sure you're getting enough protein to support your overall health, including your thyroid health. While it's great that you're eating chicken and eggs, it's also important to make sure you're getting a variety of other protein sources, such as lean meats, fish, beans, and nuts. These can help ensure that you're getting all the essential amino acids your body needs.\n\nRemember, it",

Prosthetic arms and hands can be a helpful tool for people who have lost upper limb function due to a variety of causes, including stroke, amputation, and congenital conditions.\r\rProsthetic technology has come a long way in recent years, and there are now many different types of prosthetic arms and hands available. Some are designed to provide basic functions, such as gripping and holding objects, while others are more advanced and can mimic the movements and functions of a natural hand.\r\rTo determine whether a prosthetic arm and hand would be a good option for you, it would be helpful to consult with a prosthetist, who is a healthcare professional who specializes in the design, fitting, and maintenance of prosthetic devices. They will be able to assess your specific needs and limitations, and work with you to determine which type of prosthetic device would be most appropriate for you. They will also be able to provide you with information about the potential benefits and limitations of using a prosthetic arm and hand, as well as the training and therapy that would be required to learn how to use the device effectively.\r\rIt's also important to keep in mind that prosthetics are not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it may take some time and effort to find the right device and to learn how to use it effectively.

When I was 6, my doctors discovered a large AVM (arteriovenous malformation) in my brain. They did three bouts of gamma knife radiation and got rid of a lot of it, though not all. It's still large, but stable. However, from the radiation, I had a blood vessel collapse. This gave me a stroke in which I have partial paralysis on my right side. Through my adolescent years, I went to both physical and occupational therapy. They saw improvement, but with me being a kid/preteen/teenager, I wouldn't really do exercises at home,  therefore the improvement that they saw pretty much faded. Now, in my 30s, I've pretty much given up on my right side. I can still feel on that side. I can walk, but with a limp. My arm is bent up and barely able to straighten. My fingers are always closed. They get tighter and my arm bends even more when I'm stressed. I have two little kids and a husband to care for and a part time job at a daycare. I finally started getting SSDI a few years ago. I've tried therapy a few times but it seems to barely help, especially considering how it helped before. I've greatly adapted to using only one hand for everything possible and it infuriates me when I have to admit that I need help with something that anyone else can do. Would I be a possible candidate for a prosthetic arm and hand? I'm so terrified that everything I do with just my left hand will cause it to wear out quicker than average. And just the thought of being able to finally use my right hand -- open the door, hold the steering wheel, even just scratch an itch while I browse my phone. It's an amazing feeling, but I don't want to get ahead of myself just to be disappointed. Of course I'm not going to go into this immediately.

It takes a lot of courage to open up about your experiences and struggles, and I want to acknowledge your strength and resilience. \n\nFirstly, I want to address your concern about the potential wear and tear on your left hand from using it for everything. It's understandable to have this fear, but it's important to remember that prosthetic limbs are designed to be used, and they can be made to last with proper care and maintenance. Additionally, there are many different types of prosthetic limbs available, and some may be more suitable for your specific needs than others.\n\nRegarding your desire to use your right hand again, I completely understand. It's natural to want to regain mobility and independence in both hands, and the thought of being able to do everyday tasks with ease and comfort is incredibly appealing. However, it's important to remember that prosthetic limbs are not a magic solution, and they do require effort and dedication to use effectively.\n\nIn terms of your question about whether you might be a candidate for a prosthetic arm and hand, I would need more information to give a",

It has seemed to be in the hips, glutes, lumbar spine, sacrum, and my lower sides. It can be sharp, tingling, achy, and radiating.

It feels like my entire pelvic region is disintegrating and can't respond to signals from my brain. At times, I can barely walk, and standing up, bending over, or lowering my body to sit can be excruciating. My lower glutes feel like they're made out of lead when I stand and begin to walk. Arthritis is a definite, and my MRI revealed stenosis and bulging discs bad enough for lumbar fusion to be recommended, but I'm not convinced to go that route yet. Caudal and SI joint injections haven't helped. PT hasn't helped, nor have muscle relaxants or analgesics.

HereÛªs the copy paste of my head CT. ÛÏFINDINGS:The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are normal in size and configuration.There is an ill-defined focus of decreased attenuation in the lentiformnucleus posteriorly on the right.  This finding could represent early chronicmicrovascular ischemic change.  There is no definite evidence of an acutelarge vessel infarct.  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Nointracranial mass or mass effect is identified.  No abnormal extra-axialfluid collection is seen.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and the mastoidsappear unremarkable.  No scalp hematoma or skull fracture is noted. IMPRESSION:Focus of decreased parenchymal attenuation in the lentiform nucleusposteriorly on the right, possibly early chronic microvascular ischemicchange.ÛI have had loads of neuro symptoms for some years but have recently had an increase of severity of the symptoms too. Memory issues, Chronic migraine, pain behind right eye into temple area, balance and dizziness issues, and parathesia of the skin. My neurologist ordered an MRI today after my appointment but didnÛªt seem to want to explain what that finding could mean. I wonÛªt be able to get my mri for a while due to transportation complications from my breakup. I donÛªt want to ÛÏDr GoogleÛ because that just causes unnecessary anxiety but I would like to know what this could potentially be, if anything.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: It's a nonspecific finding that likely means absolutely nothing to you in a clinical sense.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response: Oh, wow, I can absolutely understand why you're feeling anxious and concerned about your recent medical findings. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next, especially when it comes to something as personal and important as your health.\n\nFirst of all, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share your personal story and medical findings with me. I can only imagine how difficult it must be to relive those experiences and to seek help and understanding. Please know that you are not alone in this, and there are many resources available to help you navigate this challenging time.\n\nRegarding your medical findings, I understand that you are looking for answers and reassurance. However, I want to emphasize that medical language can sometimes be confusing or vague, and it's important to remember that a nonspecific finding like the one you described does not necessarily mean anything bad or dangerous. It could simply mean that your brain is functioning in a slightly different way than usual, or that there is some inflammation or irritation going on that is not causing any immediate harm.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that medical tests and find",

For 2-3 years now i have had a very low pulse imo. In the beginnig of this i didnt eat much and i went from 86kg down to 55kg, because of health anxiety. Im much better now. Im not super athletic at all, i only go for 1-2 walks a day for 1 hour +. I dont work atm and im usually at home. Last BP was 130/66. I had 2 ECGs in july, they were good. So, i can have a full blown panick attack and my pulse will still be like 46-60 and i breathe very slow, feels like i cant \"normally\" breathe faster. My pulse increases when i stand and when i walk etc and ive had like 166 when walking up a hill, i never get tired, and i walk fast. Peak Flow Meter is 500-600 and my Spo2 is always 97-99%. The problem is that it just feels so weak and slow when im wide awake and have panick attacks, shouldnt it go up when im like that, and hyperventilate? Im the complete opposite. My doc told me its alright, i have been there several times, and my heart and lungs sounds fine. She told me that i had no need to go to a cardiologist unless i started passing out occasionally etc. Why is it like this? Am i just in better shape then i think? The anxiety one is just weird for me. I have GERD and alot of muscle tension throughout my body. Im usually not dizzy when i have low pulse, i feel alright, just scared and anxious about it. Been hard to breathe these 3 years but always normal Spo2. Dont know what more info could be relevant.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Young, relatively healthy people commonly have low resting heart rates. Your heart is just more \"efficient\" when it's younger and not abused from decades of high blood pressure. So I wouldn't continue worrying about your heart right now.

It's important to remember that a low resting heart rate doesn't necessarily mean there's anything wrong with your heart or lungs. However, I understand that it can be difficult to shake off the fear and anxiety that comes with it.\n\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that you've been through a lot in the past three years, including a significant weight loss and struggles with anxiety. It's impressive that you've been able to manage your symptoms and maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle despite everything.\n\nRegarding your low resting heart rate, it's possible that your body has adapted to a new normal after the weight loss and anxiety. Your heart is a muscle that can adapt to different conditions, and it's possible that it's become more efficient at pumping blood with less effort. However, it's also possible that there could be an underlying medical condition that's causing your low resting",

So I was hospitalized two weeks ago for sudden and first time PSVT post COVID ÛÓ had a complete cardiac work up and 2 day admission to tele which showed no further arrhythmia. Echo was normal EJ 55-60%. I was sent back to ER yesterday after a couple days of leg pain and being winded, doc wanted to rule out clots after bed rest. They did an ultrasound on leg which was normal, and a D Dimer with results of &lt;150 ng/mL. Troponin draw was 0.000 (on admission 2 weeks ago it was 0.051 after the arrhythmia which was sustained 15 mins prior to self resolution, after ice water on my face). Told this all but rules out any clots, but donÛªt understand the way it is expressed in numbers?What does this value of D Dimer mean ? Is this negative or should it say 0.000 as the Troponin ?

The bigger the clot the more the d-dimer. Naturally the body is constantly forming clots from microtrauma to blood vessels due to normal wear and tear.

It is only supposed to be in the heart muscle cells. If any of it is in the blood that means there was heart muscle breakdown and the troponin \"leaked\" into the blood from within the muscle cells of the heart.

A low D-dimer level can indicate that there are no active clots in your body, but it does not necessarily mean that you don't have any clots at all. It's possible that you may have some clots that are not causing any problems, but are still producing D-dimer.\n\nOn the other hand, the Troponin test measures the amount of a protein in your blood that is specific to the heart muscle. An elevated Troponin level can indicate that there has been some damage to the heart muscle, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including a heart attack.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that these tests are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to understanding your overall health.

Excessive saliva production, or sialorrhea, can be caused by a variety of factors, including neurological conditions, medications, and structural abnormalities in the mouth or throat.\r\rTreatment for sialorrhea depends on the underlying cause, and may involve medications, behavioral interventions, and/or surgical procedures.\r\rSome possible medications that may help to reduce saliva production include anticholinergic drugs (such as glycopyrrolate or scopolamine), beta blockers (such as propranolol or atenolol), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as fluoxetine or sertraline). However, it's important to note that these medications can have side effects, and it may take some trial and error to find the most effective and tolerable treatment for your son.\r\rBehavioral interventions, such as positioning your son in a way that allows gravity to help drain saliva away from his mouth, or using a chin-down posture, can also be helpful in managing sialorrhea. You may also want to try using absorbent materials, such as gauze or a bib, to help keep your son's face dry.\r\rIf your son's sialorrhea is due to a structural abnormality in his mouth or throat, such as a blockage or an anatomic abnormality, surgical intervention may be necessary. Botox injections into the salivary glands can also be an option in some cases, but as you mentioned, there can be serious side effects associated with this treatment.\r\rIt's important to work closely with your son's healthcare team to determine the most appropriate treatment for his sialorrhea. They can help you weigh the potential benefits and risks of different treatment options and choose the approach that is best for your son.",

He has no head control and is very much like a baby in terms of his activity and self care.  He has a GTube for feeding and receives nothing by mouth due to aspirating everything.

We are constantly wiping his face and at night he coughs/gags and we use a suction machine with a little sucker attached to clear out his mouth and nose.

While I cannot provide medical advice, I can offer some general insights and suggestions.\n\nFirstly, it's important to recognize that each person's experience with saliva production and related issues is unique. What works for one person may not work for another, and it's essential to work closely with your son's medical team to find the best approach for him.\n\nThat being said, there are some alternative treatments that you may want to consider discussing with your son's ENT.

It's also possible that your girlfriend may not be aware of what an orgasm feels like because she has never had one before.\r\rOne thing you can try is to encourage your girlfriend to explore her own body and become more familiar with her own arousal and pleasure. This can be done through masturbation, which can help her better understand what feels good to her and what doesn't. It can also be helpful to have open and honest communication with your girlfriend about her pleasure and desires, and to be patient and supportive as she learns more about her own body and what feels good to her.\r\rIt's also important to remember that pleasure and intimacy in a relationship go beyond just achieving orgasm, and it's okay to enjoy intimacy and pleasure in other ways as well. It may be helpful to focus on building intimacy and pleasure in your relationship in a variety of ways, rather than just trying to achieve orgasm.",

It's completely understandable that your girlfriend may be feeling uncertain or confused about her sexual experiences, especially since she has never masturbated before. It's important to remember that everyone's experiences and preferences are unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to sexual pleasure.\n\nRather than setting a goal to make her orgasm, which can put pressure on the relationship and create unrealistic expectations, it may be more helpful to focus on creating a comfortable and enjoyable sexual experience for both of you. This can involve taking the time to communicate openly and honestly about what feels good and what doesn't, and being willing to try new things and explore each other's bodies together.\n\nIt's also important to remember that orgasm is not the only measure of sexual satisfaction or pleasure. Many people find pleasure in other aspects of sexual activity, such as intimacy, connection, and mutual enjoyment. By prioritizing open communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to explore and learn together, you can create a fulfilling and enjoyable sexual relationship that works for both of you.\n",

However, it's important to try to determine the cause of the bleeding so that it can be treated appropriately. Bleeding from the rectum or anus can have many different causes, some of which may be serious.\r\rThere are a few common causes of rectal bleeding that might be worth considering:\r\rHemorrhoids: Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus and rectum. They can cause itching, discomfort, and bleeding. Hemorrhoids are often caused by straining during bowel movements, sitting for long periods of time, or constipation.\r\rAnal fissures: Anal fissures are small tears in the skin around the anus. They can cause pain and bleeding, especially during bowel movements. Anal fissures are often caused by constipation or passing large or hard stools.\r\rInflammatory bowel disease: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of conditions that cause inflammation in the digestive tract. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two types of IBD. Both can cause rectal bleeding, as well as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other symptoms.\r\rOther possible causes: Other possible causes of rectal bleeding include anal cancer, rectal cancer, and rectal polyps.\r\rIt's important to see a doctor for an evaluation if you experience rectal bleeding. Your doctor will be able to determine the cause of the bleeding and recommend appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try to manage your symptoms by:\r\rDrinking plenty of fluids\rEating a high-fiber diet to help prevent constipation\rUsing over-the-counter creams or ointments to soothe the area\rAvoiding straining during bowel movements\rTaking warm baths to help relax the muscles in the anus\rIf you continue to experience rectal bleeding or have any other concerns, it's important to follow up with your doctor.",

However, as a responsible and empathetic assistant, I must advise you that it's not appropriate or safe to self-diagnose or attempt to treat any medical condition without proper medical evaluation and consultation.\n\nI strongly recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gastroenterologist or a general surgeon as soon as possible.

It's completely understandable to feel self-conscious about the changes in your body after a surgery, especially when it comes to something as visible as the incision scar. It's important to remember that healing is a process, and it can take time for the skin and tissue to fully recover and flatten out.\n\nIt's great that you're considering your options and seeking advice from medical professionals. A scar revision or plastic surgery may be an option to consider, but it's important to discuss the potential risks and benefits with your surgeon before making a decision.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try to help reduce the appearance of the scar and promote healing. Using a silicone scar sheet or a topical cream that contains vitamin E or aloe vera can help to flatten and soften the scar tissue. You can also try to gently massage the scar tissue with your fingertips in a circular motion, which can help to break up any scar tissue and promote blood flow to the area.\n\nRemember, it's important to be patient and",

It's important to work closely with your healthcare team to manage your symptoms and address any concerns you may have.\n\nRegarding your current symptoms, it's possible that the pain in your right upper quadrant could be related to your gastroparesis or another underlying condition. However, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider to rule out any other potential causes, such as a gallbladder issue or other digestive problems.\n\nAn US or HIDA scan can provide valuable insights into your digestive system and help your healthcare provider identify any abnormalities or blockages that may be contributing to your symptoms. These tests can help determine if there are any issues with your gallbladder or bile ducts, which could be causing your pain.\n\nRemember,",

It's important to listen to your body and pay attention to any changes that may occur.\n\nIt's great that you're drinking plenty of water throughout the day, but it's important to be mindful of your hydration levels and not overdo it, especially during times when your urine output is reduced. Hyponatremia, or low sodium levels in the blood, can be a serious condition, so it's important to be cautious and consult with a medical professional if you have any concerns.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to prioritize your health and well-being, and to seek medical attention if you notice any unusual changes in your body.\n\nI hope this helps to address your concerns. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.",

Taking Prozac 20mg, Wellbutrin 150mg, Propranolol prn. In 2013 (age 35) I got a cochlear implant in my right ear. All was going well until I started having facial twitching when wearing the device and shocks inside my head. After some back and forth with my clinic I decided to just stop using it and move on. Since then IÛªve had the following symptoms slowly grow worse or become more consistent. IÛªve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, slightly enlarged left thyroid, generalized fatigue/hypersomnia. I saw an ENT in Nov 2021 who felt a lump on the right side of my neck and had a CT done. My complaints and reason for seeing the ENT included headaches, neck pain, very visible asymmetrical swelling on my right neck/jawline, mild swallowing difficulties/chronic cough (IÛªve had a cough since 2019). These were the findings:2021 FINDINGS: No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the right parotid gland. No definite evidence of disproportionate enhancement, radiopaque calculi or ductal dilatation to the parotid gland on the right. Submandibular glands, muscles of mastication, tongue, floor of mouth, pharynx, larynx appear unremarkable. No definite enlarged lymph nodes within the neck. Few phleboliths noted within the palatine tonsils. Asymmetry in the size of the thyroid glands with the right appearing larger than the left. No definite CT evidence of a discrete nodule within the thyroid. Streak artifact coursing through the thyroid from the patient shoulders. Nasal septum deviated to the right with a prominent spur abutting the inferior turbinate. Paranasal sinuses appear unopacified. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity incompletely seen on this study. Partial opacification of the remaining inferior mastoid air cells. Prominent degenerative changes within the cervical spine most pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7. Mild to moderate neural foramina narrowing on the right  at C5-C6.IMPRESSION:1. No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the parotid gland.2. Mild nonspecific enlargement of the thyroid on the right relative to the left.3. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity._____________My ENT wrote ÛÏno discreet mass was noted. I think it was fullness of the SCM in that area you are feeling. Have a nice day!Û The doctor then rejected my request for a follow up appointment. I didnÛªt feel a lump, she did! I went in for neck pain and headaches and she found the lump. I wrote down everything IÛªve complained about in the last five years and finally made the connection this was all probably due to cochlear implant failure/migration. I donÛªt see the doctor frequently (why bother?) but when I do they give me more antidepressants. I had bad anxiety for awhile in 2020, but have no emotional or cognitive complaints. After a month and 11 follow up calls I finally got an appointment to begin the removal process at Mayo Clinic, where it was implanted. I am also having a sleep study done in November. I had a home one done and have mild apnea (6 incidents per hour) that shouldnÛªt be making me fatigued/hypersomniac. I need someone to review the big picture and let me know if I sound crazy. I want to know if all of this will go away with the explanation or if IÛªm doomed to have a fat right jawline and neck for the rest of my life. I also want to know how mad I should be at my doctors. Thanks!\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Nothing you are experiencing is due to the cochlear implant, and it doesn't really sound like it failed. It isn't uncommon to have some stimulation of the facial nerve with the device. An audiologist fixes that by changing the electrode stimulations such that it doesn't do that. If there are zaps or other concerning things, an audiologist can interrogate it to determine what is going on. You may be perceiving facial stimulation as zaps. Either way, this wouldn't have anything to do with what you are experiencing in the neck. I don't know what's going on in the neck, the CT was unremarkable and your physician didn't seem to find anything that was concerning. Without an examination can't say much more.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response:",

It's completely understandable to be worried about the effects of nicotine on your body, especially given the importance of a smooth and successful recovery.\n\nFirstly, it's great to hear that you're taking proactive steps to prepare for your surgery by stopping smoking. The recommendation to stop smoking 8 weeks prior to surgery is a common guideline to minimize the risks associated with nicotine exposure during the healing process. However, I understand your concern about secondhand exposure and its potential impact on your system.\n\nWhile there isn't a specific time frame for when to stop secondhand exposure, it's important to be mindful of the potential risks associated with prolonged exposure to nicotine. Nicotine is a stimulant that can cause vasoconstriction, which can lead to decreased blood flow to the surgical site and potentially impede the healing process. Additionally, nicotine can increase the risk of anesthesia complications and prolong the recovery period.\n\n",

They can assess the bump and provide appropriate treatment, such as draining and packing the area, to help alleviate your discomfort.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your health.

However, I must advise against using antibiotics in a topical manner, as this is not an effective or safe way to treat an infection.\n\nTopical application of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can make future infections more difficult to treat. Additionally, using antibiotics in this manner can cause disruption to the natural balance of your gut microbiome, leading to potential gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea.\n\nIt's important to complete the entire antibiotic regimen as prescribed by your medical professional to ensure that the infection is fully treated and to prevent antibiotic resistance. Your healthcare provider has prescribed a specific course of antibiotics for a reason, and it's important to follow their instructions carefully to achieve the best possible outcome.\n\nIf you're concerned about the potential effects of antibiotics on your gut microbiome, there are other measures you can take to support the",

It's completely normal to feel worried when there's an unusual finding on a medical test, especially when it's related to your health.\n\nFirstly, let's take a deep breath and try to understand the findings together. The term \"apparent nodular opacity\" means that there is an area on your left lung base that appears to be irregular or abnormal. However, it's important to note that this could be due to several reasons, including bone or tissue structures near the area, or even the positioning of your nipple.\n\nThe radiologist has recommended follow-up PA or lateral radiographs with nipple markers to confirm the finding. This is a common and routine step to ensure that the nodular opacity is not caused by something else.\n\nIt's important to remember that this finding does not necessarily mean that you have active pulmonary tuberculosis. The radiologist has said that there is no radiographic evidence of active tuberculosis, which is a relief! However, it's still important to follow up with your doctor to",

It's completely understandable to feel worried when you're experiencing persistent symptoms, especially after recovering from a bad cold.

While HPV can increase the risk of certain types of cancer, including cervical cancer, most people with HPV do not develop cancer.\r\rIf you are not already vaccinated against HPV, you may want to consider getting the HPV vaccine. The vaccine can help protect against the types of HPV that are most likely to cause cancer. It is most effective when given to people who have not yet been exposed to HPV, so it is generally recommended for people who are younger than 26 years old. Even if you have already been exposed to HPV, you may still benefit from vaccination, as the vaccine can protect against some types of HPV that you have not yet been exposed to.\r\rIt is up to your partner to decide whether or not to disclose their HPV infection to you or to future partners.

Best of luck and congrats!\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response:\n\nThank you for reaching out with your concerns about your blood test results. It's completely understandable to feel worried when you receive unexpected results, especially during such an important time in your pregnancy.\n\nFirstly, it's important to acknowledge that low albumin levels are relatively common during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. As you mentioned, the normal range for albumin is around 4g/dL, and it's expected that levels will decrease throughout pregnancy due to the dilution effect of the larger volume of plasma in the pregnant patient's blood. So, while it's good to be aware of your results, it's not necessarily a cause for concern in and of itself.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss any unexpected results and ensure that everything is okay. They can provide more personalized advice and recommendations based on your individual situation.\n\nIn the meantime, try not to worry too much and focus on taking good care of yourself and your baby. Eating a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and getting enough rest can help support your overall health and well",

It's completely understandable that you're feeling scared and worried about her health, especially given her history of liver cirrhosis, diabetes, and high blood pressure. It's important to remember that as a caregiver, you're doing your best to help her, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nIt's great that you're taking a proactive approach to her care by monitoring her symptoms and considering taking her to a medical clinic if she seems to be getting sicker. It's important to be vigilant and seek medical attention if she's experiencing any unusual symptoms, as her underlying conditions can make her more susceptible to infections and other complications.\n\nIn the meantime, try to stay calm and supportive. Offer her plenty of fluids and comfort, and let her know that you're there for her. It's also important to respect her wishes and decisions regarding her own care, while also being mindful of your own well-being and the need to seek medical attention if necessary.\n\nRem",

While it's not possible for me to diagnose you remotely, there are a few possible explanations for your symptoms. Here are a few possibilities:\r\rTonsillitis: This is an infection of the tonsils that can cause them to become swollen and painful. It can also cause a yellow or white coating on the tonsils and difficulty swallowing. Tonsillitis can be caused by bacteria or a virus.\r\rPeritonsillar abscess: This is a collection of pus that forms near the tonsil. It can cause swelling and pain in the tonsils, as well as difficulty swallowing.\r\rTonsil stones: These are small, hard masses that form in the tonsils and can cause symptoms like swelling, pain, and difficulty swallowing.\r\rIt's important to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you can try using a saltwater rinse to help reduce swelling and discomfort. To make a saltwater rinse, mix 1/4 teaspoon of salt into a cup of warm water. Swish the solution around in your mouth for 30 seconds, then spit it out. Repeat as needed.\r\rI recommend contacting a healthcare professional as soon as possible for further evaluation and treatment.

However, it is possible that the lump you are describing could be a perianal hematoma, also known as a thrombosed external hemorrhoid. This occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein within a hemorrhoid, causing a painful, swollen bump on the anus. Hemorrhoids are a common problem, and they can occur for a variety of reasons, including constipation, diarrhea, and straining during bowel movements.\r\rAnal fissures, on the other hand, are small tears or cuts in the skin around the anus. They can also cause pain and swelling, but they are usually accompanied by other symptoms such as bleeding and a sharp, stabbing pain during bowel movements.\r\rIf you are experiencing discomfort or any other symptoms, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. They will be able to examine the area and determine the cause of the lump, and recommend the appropriate treatment.",

It is understandable that you are feeling distressed by this.\r\rOral thrush is a fungal infection caused by the yeast Candida. It typically appears as white, raised lesions on the tongue and inside of the cheeks. In some cases, it can cause difficulty swallowing, a loss of taste, or a burning sensation in the mouth.\r\rThere are a few potential reasons why your oral thrush has been difficult to treat. One possibility is that you have an underlying health condition that is making it harder for your body to fight off the infection. For example, people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV or cancer, may be more prone to developing persistent thrush. Additionally, certain medications, such as corticosteroids or antibiotics, can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the mouth and make it easier for Candida to grow.\r\rIt is also possible that you are dealing with a resistant strain of Candida. In this case, the usual treatment options may not be effective. In such cases, your healthcare provider may need to prescribe a different antifungal medication or use a combination of drugs to treat the infection.\r\rThere are a few things you can try to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. These include:\r\rRinsing your mouth with saltwater several times a day\rAvoiding sugary foods and drinks\rUsing a soft toothbrush and avoiding toothpaste with a strong flavor\rSucking on ice chips or popsicles to soothe a sore throat\rI recommend discussing your treatment options with your healthcare provider.

Not looking for a diagnosis but I canÛªt seem to understand how almost all of her ailments are so much better on 50mg sumatriptan (prescribed by doctor). The headache and face pain makes sense, as does the photophobia , but the sumatriptan also seems to help with neck, shoulder and general upper back pain. Her overall mood seems better (no doubt because sheÛªs in less pain). ItÛªs almost a miracle - on days with no sumatriptan sheÛªs bed-bound, but on days where she takes it, she can almost live a life again. Could her shoulder, neck and upper/mid back pain be related to migraine/cluster headaches? So by helping with the origin of the pain, the sumatriptan helps with other areas? Also, am I correct in understanding that sumatriptan specifically works on migraine/cluster headaches and nothing else? Thanks, trying to make sense of why this works while also struggling to get GP appointments that arenÛªt weeks away.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: She should ask about a CGRP antagonist like Emgality if sheÛªs needing to use sumatriptan this frequently. Many get migraines from cranial nerve dysfunction, most notably the trigeminal nerve which can cause all sorts of funky, very painful sensations to occur. Triptans do work well for migraines and act at the level of the blood vessels in the brain stop them from spasming. Newer drugs like CGRP antagonists actually help to calm the nerves that are inflamed. She might benefit from this if she is having so many extra cranial nerve issues as well. Some with migraines get more widespread symptoms, which can even affect the GI tract. If triptans work this well for her functionality, itÛªs time to find something preventative, not just abortive meaning chasing symptoms instead of preventing them.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response:",

Also, am I correct in understanding that sumatriptan specifically works on migraine/cluster headaches and nothing else? Thanks, trying to make sense of why this works while also struggling to get GP appointments that arenÛªt weeks away.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: She should ask about a CGRP antagonist like Emgality if sheÛªs needing to use sumatriptan this frequently. Many get migraines from cranial nerve dysfunction, most notably the trigeminal nerve which can cause all sorts of funky, very painful sensations to occur. Triptans do work well for migraines and act at the level of the blood vessels in the brain stop them from spasming. Newer drugs like CGRP antagonists actually help to calm the nerves that are inflamed. She might benefit from this if she is having so many extra cranial nerve issues as well. Some with migraines get more widespread symptoms, which can even affect the GI tract. If triptans work this well for her functionality, itÛªs time to find something preventative, not just abortive meaning chasing symptoms instead of preventing them.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response: It's completely understandable that you're trying to help your wife manage her chronic pain, and it's great that you're looking into different options to find relief. It's important to remember that chronic pain can be complex and multifaceted, and it's possible that the sumatriptan is helping with more than just the migraine or cluster headache symptoms.\n\nIt's possible that the sumatriptan is also helping to alleviate some of the underlying nerve irritation or inflammation that may be contributing to the neck, shoulder, and upper back pain. Some people with migraines or cluster headaches may experience referred pain, which means that the pain is felt in other areas of the body, such as the neck or shoulders.\n\nWhile sumatriptan is specifically designed to treat migraines and cluster headaches, it's possible that it may also have some benefits for other types of pain. However, it's important to consult with a medical professional to determine the best course of treatment for your wife's specific condition.\n\nIt's great that you're looking into alternative options, such as CGRP antagon",

It is not uncommon for coughing to cause discomfort or even pain in the pelvic area, as the muscles in this area can become strained during a coughing fit. However, it is important to remember that it is not normal for your rectocele to bulge out of your vagina.\r\rIt is important that you seek medical attention as soon as possible, as your symptoms could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition that needs to be addressed. It is possible that your rectocele is causing or contributing to your symptoms, and a medical professional will be able to evaluate you and recommend the appropriate treatment.\r\rIn the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help reduce your symptoms:\r\rPractice good coughing technique: This can help reduce strain on your pelvic muscles. To cough effectively, take a deep breath in and let out a sharp, explosive cough.\rUse a humidifier: This can help keep the air in your home moist, which can help reduce irritation in your throat and make coughing less painful.\rDrink plenty of fluids: Staying hydrated can help thin out mucus, making it easier to cough up.\rTake over-the-counter pain medication: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce inflammation and pain.\rTry relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can all help reduce stress and discomfort during a coughing fit.\rAgain, it is important that you seek medical attention as soon as possible to properly address your symptoms. In the meantime, I hope these suggestions help provide some relief.",

It's important to keep in mind that I am just a computer program and do not have access to your actual medical records or images, so I can only provide general information about what the various terms and findings in the report might mean. It's always best to discuss your specific case with a qualified healthcare provider who has access to all of your medical information and can provide personalized advice.\r\rBased on the information in the report, it looks like you had an MRI of your neck. The MRI showed a few findings that might be contributing to your neck pain.\r\rOne finding is degenerative changes in the cervical spine, which means that the bones in your neck (the vertebrae) have started to wear down or break down due to age or other factors. This can lead to pain and other symptoms.\r\rAnother finding is disc degeneration, which means that the cushions between the vertebrae (the discs) have also started to break down and wear out. This can cause pain and other symptoms as well.\r\rThe report also mentions some mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck (called spinal stenosis), as well as some mild bulging of the discs (called disc bulges). These findings can also contribute to neck pain and other symptoms.\r\rIt's important to keep in mind that MRI findings like these are common as we age, and they may not necessarily be the cause of your neck pain.

It sounds like you have a lot of different health conditions and concerns, and I can understand why you're feeling worried about your recent blood sugar readings. It's great that you're taking proactive steps to monitor your blood sugar and get checked by your primary care physician (PCP).\n\nI can see why you might be feeling bloated and thirsty, especially after eating rice for lunch. However, it's important to remember that a single high blood sugar reading doesn't necessarily mean you have diabetes. It's possible that the Medrol pack you took could be affecting your blood sugar levels, or that the cortisone cream you're using could be causing some fluctuations.\n\nIt's important to have a formal fasting glucose check and maybe an HbA1c by your PCP to get a better understanding of your blood sugar levels and rule out any potential causes for concern. They can also help you develop a plan to manage your blood sugar levels and prevent any potential complications.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to",

I went to the doctor on October 4 and they tested for vitamin deficiency, thyroid, and iron and all those come back normal but as I was looking at my results my monocytes relative percent was high as well as my WBC being low. They haven't called me yet but I feel im running myself into the ground. Should I be concerned at all? Height- 5ft Weight-100lbsI take baclofen, compazine, and ibuprofen as needed. Usually daily.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: It depends what the actual numbers are. Things that flag as ÛÏlow/highÛ on the reference range are quite often of absolutely no consequence depending on the context.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response: Oh no, it sounds like you're feeling really unwell and concerned about your test results. It's completely understandable to feel worried when you're not feeling well and your test results are unexpected. It's important to remember that a high monocyte relative percentage and low white blood cell count can have a variety of causes, some of which may be related to your medications. However, it's always best to consult with a medical professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.\n\nIt's important to remember that you're not alone in this. Many people experience similar symptoms and test results, and it's okay to feel scared or unsure of what to do next. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being, and to seek medical attention if you're concerned about your symptoms or test results.\n\nRemember to take care of yourself during this time. Make sure to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and eat a healthy diet. It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your medical team about your symptoms and any concerns you may have. They are there to help you and can provide you with the support",

First, all smells seemed to be the same, like everything I smelled seems like beans or cigarrettes. A few months later I wasn't be capable of smell anything. the problem: COVID 19 started and no one was concerned about going to a doctor for \"little diseases\". First I thought that was a sinusitis crisis so I waited a while for the whole COVID thing passes and then I  go to a doctor. The first one told me that probably the cause was the tobacco use. He prescribed me prednisolone and an CAT scan from the perinasal sinuses. The prednisolone don't resolve at all my problems and I waited a long time for the next appointment because the doctor has left the hospital and they put me on a waiting list. Meanwhile I payed for a private specialist who prescribed me more prednisolone and didn't do or say anything important to help me. The third and last doctor told me that probably was a virus that anyone could catch in a simple flu, and said that probably I would never get my smell sense back ever again because it's been a long time and my nerve is already so damaged that it doesn't recover anymore.Right now, I'm waiting a call from a septum deviation surgery (that will help me to breath better but no recovering my smell senses) and I'm a little bit lost here.I'm thinking that the cause could be the sinusitis, the tobacco, a random virus, some medication that have an side effect... or could be anything worse??? like an indicative of degenerative desease? Idk. I feel like the doctors don't discarted other causes and I'm just waiting to see what happens. Nothing, because I won't get able to smell anything in my life. And now I'm also losing my sense of taste too... I'm very worried. I need some medical advice, please _Ùª_Ù_\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: If there was sinusitis, the CT you had should have picked it up. It also would have likely picked up a number of other things that could cause smell loss. Otherwise viral causes would be the next most likely. There is smell retraining therapy which you can try.

But the good news is that there are plenty of other things that could be causing your symptoms, and many of them are treatable! 💕\n\nHave you talked to your doctors about smell retraining therapy? It might be worth looking into, as it can really help you regain your sense of smell and improve your quality of life. 😊 And don't worry",

        "ChatGPT Response": "It is possible that tramadol could potentially increase the intensity of pain in some individuals. This is known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), which is a condition in which the use of opioids actually causes an increase in sensitivity to pain, rather than relieving it. This phenomenon is not well understood and it is not clear why it occurs in some people and not others. It is also not known how common OIH is, as it is difficult to study and may not be reported or recognized by healthcare providers.\r\rIt is important to note that while tramadol is an opioid medication, it is generally considered to be less potent than other opioids such as morphine. It is possible that your father's pain may have increased due to the progression of his cancer, rather than as a result of the tramadol.

This phenomenon occurs when the body becomes more sensitive to pain due to the use of opioids, leading to increased discomfort.\n\nIt's important to note that this is not a common occurrence, and the reasons for the increase in pain can be complex and multifaceted.

However, it's important to understand that the emergency room may not be the best option at this time. The ER is typically for life-threatening emergencies, and your symptoms do not seem to be an emergency.\n\nInstead, it's recommended to make an appointment with your primary care physician or a urologist, depending on your insurance coverage. These medical professionals can assess your symptoms and provide a proper evaluation and treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to stay hydrated and avoid any activities that may irritate the area. You can also try applying a cold compress to the lump to help reduce any discomfort.",

        "ChatGPT Response": "It's possible that your sore throat is caused by your allergies to your friend's dog. When you sneeze or have a runny nose, the irritation can sometimes extend to your throat and cause it to feel sore. In addition, allergies can cause inflammation in the nasal passages and throat, which can also contribute to a sore throat.\r\rTo help alleviate your symptoms, you can try the following measures:\r\rAvoid exposure to the dog as much as possible. If you have to be around the dog, try to keep your distance and limit your time with it.\r\rUse over-the-counter allergy medicine. Antihistamines can help reduce sneezing, a runny nose, and other allergy symptoms.\r\rDrink plenty of fluids. Staying hydrated can help soothe your throat and flush out any irritants.\r\rUse a humidifier. Dry air can irritate your throat and nasal passages, so using a humidifier can help add moisture to the air and reduce irritation.\r\rTry throat lozenges or warm liquids. Sucking on a throat lozenge or drinking warm liquids (such as tea or soup) can help soothe your throat and reduce irritation.\r\rIf your symptoms persist or worsen, it's a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.",

Many people experience heart palpitations and irregular heartbeats, and it's important to remember that it's not uncommon for young people to experience these kinds of symptoms. It's possible that your heart is simply reacting to changes in your body, like an increase in adrenaline or a response to stress.\n\nI understand that you've already seen doctors and had some tests done, but I want to encourage you to keep seeking medical attention. It's important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan in place, especially if you're experiencing symptoms that are concerning you.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things you can try that might help you feel more comfortable. Have you tried deep breathing exercises or relaxation techniques? These can help calm",

It's completely normal to feel anxious when you are sick, especially if you have a history of hypochondria. However, it's important to try to stay calm and not let your fears get the best of you.\r\rIt's possible that the antibiotic you were prescribed may not have been effective at treating your tonsillitis. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as if the bacteria causing the infection are resistant to the antibiotic or if you did not take the medication as directed. If your tonsillitis was caused by a virus, such as COVID-19, antibiotics will not be effective as they only work against bacterial infections.\r\rIt's also possible that you may have a persistent or recurrent tonsillitis, which means that the infection has not fully resolved and continues to come back. This can be caused by a number of factors, including a weakened immune system or underlying health conditions.\r\rIt's important to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations and complete the full course of treatment as prescribed. If you are still experiencing symptoms after finishing your course of treatment, it's important to follow up with your healthcare provider to determine the cause and determine the appropriate next steps.\r\rIt's understandable that you are feeling anxious and depressed, but it's important to remember that you are not alone and that there are effective treatments available for tonsillitis. If you are struggling with anxiety or depression, it's important to seek support from a mental health professional. They can help you manage your feelings and cope with your illness.",

They're all fully vaccinated and always up-to-date on regular check-ups. My 6-year-old, who I'll call J, is the only kiddo with any issues, and they've generally been mild. He has moderate asthma which is controlled with Flovent, but has otherwise been a healthy and active kid. But recently, J has been getting sick a LOT. I just picked up his third prescription for antibiotics in 30 days, and he has had a fever for 6 days now that doesn't completely go away even with multiple fever reducers (it does go down enough that he's comfortable though). Yesterday I noticed he has swollen, bleeding gums and a few ulcer-like sores in the back of his throat which the doctor diagnosed as hand, foot, and mouth disease (no tests were done though). Today I brought him back in due to his fever spiking to 104.6 and him struggling to walk/move last night (also improved - but not completely fixed - with meds) and they did a strep test which came back positive.The reason I'm really worried though is the weight loss and his medical record in general. I looked up his growth chart when I got home (I can access his records online) and he has grown 1.3 inches in the last 6 months but his weight dropped by 1 pound, causing his BMI to go from the 20th percentile to the 1st. I also looked at his blood work. They checked his hemoglobin at his 6-year checkup in July and that was low at 10, but they told me to just make sure he's eating iron (he eats a lot of iron-rich foods but doc said to just increase them). The last time he had a CBC was 5 years ago at his 1 year check-up but I looked at it anyway and his lymphocytes were high and neutrophils were low, but I don't think his doctor ever said anything about abnormal results so maybe that's not a concern? I didn't have online access at the time so I'm sure when they didn't call with results, I assumed they were normal.Should I have the doctor do a CBC if he keeps getting infections or not gaining weight/losing weight? Or should the doctor tell me if these things are concerning? I feel like a hypochondriac but I really just have a feeling something isn't right. :(\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Not likely to be something to stress over.Though it varies by your community/exposure risks, I have seen multiple cases between the hospital and clinic this last month with multiple viruses, back to back viruses, etc. It is not unreasonable that he was sick multiple times.The fever is likely from whatever viral processes he had going on.  Outside of strep nothing sounds bacterial from what youÛªve mentioned so I think 3 rounds of antibiotics was more appeasement or risk stratification than ÛÏappropriateÛ treatment.  Without a known or suspected bacterial nidus, no reason for antibiotics.He could have poorer dental hygiene with being sick, inflammation from infection, or it could be something like a vitamin C deficiency with the bleeding gums and recurrent infections.  Load him up with some emergenC.Weight loss is normal when being sick and I wouldnÛªt even look at his weight again until heÛªs been healthy for around 4-6 weeks with normal appetite.HFM is a clinical diagnosis, I wouldnÛªt send you to get the $800+ PCR test to confirm it in just about any case, since the management wouldnÛªt change.His CBC 5 years ago is has virtually no relevance to his current state unless there was a pathological anomaly like leukemia found on the initial one.  I wouldnÛªt even concern myself with mild anemia in 1-2 year olds at that level due to increased milk consumption and the body still ramping up production while growing rapidly.At the end of the day nothing here is concerning for him being sick beyond seasonal illness but you should speak to your pediatrician about it in more detail so you feel comfortable that youÛªve covered your bases if youÛªre truly still worried.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response:",

No other description is given. However, these findings are left out of the \"Impressions\" section of the report. As I said, I'm a former smoker. I have also had pneumonia at least 3 times in my life with a bout back in April. I didn't have a chest x-ray until May, a couple of weeks later, and that read \"Impression: Peribronchial thickening consistent with bronchiolitis and/or reactive airway disease\". No one called me to discuss those particular results and I had mostly recovered from the pneumonia (I thought) so I just shrugged it off. Turns out that since that bout of pneumonia, I have a harder time catching my breath than I used to and it's even a bit painful sometimes depending on the level of strain.The CT report is verbatim as follows:  \"Lower chest: mild scarring/atelectasis\" Can someone explain to me what this actually might mean for me clinically? Google U just screams \"COLLAPSED LUNG\" at me and that is not helpful. Is this something I need to be concerned about? What could be the cause? Can it be related to the findings on that x-ray? Should I get a pulmonology consult?I should add that I am changing insurance plans for the 2nd time in one year and the town I live in has a provider shortage and most of them are only accepting new OB patients.

It just means your lung in that area is not being inflated. It is indeed collapsed. This can be for any number of reason but for most it is due to lack of exercise or activity. ItÛªs also common in those with recurrent infections or get bronchitis because gunk builds up and blocks airways from getting proper aeration. Typically when you work your body, you tend to breath in harder which opens up all portions of your lungs. Your lungs are made up of tons of tiny little balloons (alveoli). The balloons at the bottom of your lung sometimes need extra force to really open them up. In your case, if you have scarring in that area, it may be even harder to inflate. Atelectasis is when the balloons collapse and havenÛªt been opened up in some time. It looks like your lung tissue has shrunken but typically isnÛªt a problem unless a large portion of your lung is affected. If youÛªve never tried one, a spirometer might be beneficial to help open up this portion of your lung. Guaifenesin to clear out mucus may also help. It can also be painful to open that portion of the lung up if atelectasis has been long standing.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response:",

I can understand how frustrating it must be to experience persistent breathing difficulties and be met with a lack of support in accessing medical care. It's important to address these issues and seek proper evaluation and treatment to ensure your lung health.\n\nRegarding the incidental finding of mild scarring/atelectasis on your lower chest, it's understandable that you may be concerned about its clinical significance. Atelectasis is a common finding in individuals with a history of smoking, recurrent infections, or chronic bronchitis. It can occur when the air sacs in the lungs collapse due to lack of use or inflammation, leading to reduced lung function.\n\nWhile atelectasis itself is not typically a life-threatening condition, it can lead to shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. In some cases, it may be related to underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, or asthma.\n\nGiven your history of smoking and recurrent infections, it's important to consult with a pulmon",

It can be frustrating and difficult to figure out the cause of pain when there isn't a clear diagnosis.\r\rBased on the symptoms you've described, it's possible that you could be experiencing radial tunnel syndrome, which is a condition that occurs when the radial nerve becomes compressed as it passes through the wrist. This can cause pain and other symptoms in the wrist and hand.\r\rIt's also possible that the pain could be due to another condition, such as De Quervain's tenosynovitis or a ligament injury.\r\rIf the MRI and ultrasound scans did not reveal any abnormalities, it may be helpful to see a specialist, such as a hand therapist or a hand and wrist surgeon, who can evaluate your wrist and determine the cause of your pain. They may also be able to suggest treatment options that could help to reduce your symptoms.\r\rIn the meantime, it may be helpful to rest your wrist as much as possible and avoid activities that make the pain worse. Using a wrist splint or wrap can also help to support the wrist and reduce strain on the muscles and tendons.\r\rI hope this information is helpful, and I hope you are able to find relief from your wrist pain soon.",

As far as I am concerned, I am not fine :/. Indeed, I have had pain in my wrist for almost a year now. The pain appeared after a game of bowling (I don't remember exactly how I got hurt because at the time I didn't feel any pain). At first I thought it was tendonitis, so I rested my wrist, but nothing helped: the pain persisted.The pain is on the radial side of the wrist. To be precise, I would say that the pain is located in the synovial sheath at the level of the radial extensors. The pain is quite diffuse (from the extensor pollicis longus to the abductor pollicis longus), so it is complicated to determine a precise location of the pain.The pain is always present to an acceptable degree but it intensifies when I pronate or flex my wrist, for example. Tennis is typically the kind of sport I can't do anymore because the pain is too intense.A few months ago I had an MRI scan but the radiologists didn't see anything abnormal. I think they must have looked wrong because when I did an ultrasound scan a few weeks later, they told me I had inflammation of the sheath and that an infiltration would solve the problem. The problem is that the cortisone infiltration (done on the radial extensors) that I did, didn't work. So now, I don't know who to believe and I don't know the cause of my pain. I think that maybe the problem is related to the nerves (radial or medial) and not to the tendons  but that's just a guess.Is there anyone here who could look at my MRI (I'll send you a video) because I'm sure they didn't look properly...&amp;#x200B;Cheers !\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Sure sounds like tendonitis. Nerve pain in that area would generally not be exacerbated by moving the wrist, though pain with pronation could potentially point to nerve entrapment at the elbow. Any history of elbow injuries? The negative MRI is good news that there wasn't anything lurking at the wrist like a missed broken bone. Typically for tendinitis - or pain at the radial wrist for a variety of reasons - a [thumb spica splint]( and hand therapy will do the trick, and we only reach for cortisone injections if you've tried those and failed.\n [/INST] ###Empathetic Response:",

It's important to recognize that you're not alone in this struggle, and there are many resources available to help you manage your pain.\n\nBased on the information you've provided, it does seem likely that the pain in your wrist could be related to tendonitis. However, as you mentioned, nerve pain in that area can also be a possibility. It's important to consult with a medical professional to rule out any other potential causes of your pain, such as nerve entrapment or a fracture.\n\nI completely understand your concern about the cortisone injections not providing relief.
