        "ChatGPT Response": "I'm sorry to hear about your friend's mom. It can be very difficult to navigate the healthcare system, especially when dealing with a serious medical condition like cirrhosis of the liver. Here are a few options to consider that may be able to help your friend's mom get the treatment she needs:\rTransplant centers: Many transplant centers have financial assistance programs that can help cover the cost of a transplant for uninsured or underinsured patients. These programs may be able to help your friend's mom get the transplant she needs, even if she does not have insurance.\rMedicare: If your friend's mom is over the age of 65, she may be eligible for Medicare, which is a federal health insurance program for seniors. Medicare can help cover the cost of a liver transplant, as well as other medical expenses.\rMedicaid: If your friend's mom has a low income, she may be eligible for Medicaid, which is a government-run health insurance program for low-income individuals and families. Medicaid can help cover the cost of a liver transplant, as well as other medical expenses.\rCharity care: Many hospitals and medical centers have charity care programs that provide free or discounted medical care to patients who are unable to pay. Your friend's mom may be able to get financial assistance through a charity care program.\rFundraising: Another option to consider is starting a fundraising campaign to help cover the cost of the transplant. There are a number of online platforms that make it easy to create and share a fundraising campaign. You could also reach out to local organizations or businesses to see if they would be willing to donate or help spread the word about your campaign.\rIt's important to keep in mind that getting a liver transplant is a complex process, and it may take some time to find a suitable donor and arrange for the transplant. Your friend's mom should work closely with her healthcare team to identify the best options for her situation.",

Sneezing is a sudden, forceful reflex that can cause muscle contractions throughout the body. In most cases, muscle pain or discomfort after sneezing is temporary and not a cause for concern. However, if the pain is severe or persists for a long time, it is a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\rThere are several possible causes for muscle pain after sneezing, including:\rStraining the muscles: Sneezing can cause muscle strain, particularly in the chest and neck. This can lead to muscle aches and pains, especially if you have a cold or are experiencing allergies.\rPoor posture: If you have poor posture, sneezing can put additional strain on your muscles, leading to pain.\rOther medical conditions: In some cases, muscle pain after sneezing may be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis. If you have other symptoms in addition to muscle pain after sneezing, or if the pain is severe or persistent, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\rIn conclusion, it is not uncommon to experience muscle aches or pains after sneezing.

        "ChatGPT Response": "It sounds like you are having difficulty adjusting to your new sleep schedule. It's common for people to have difficulty adjusting to a new sleep schedule, especially when it involves waking up significantly earlier than they are used to. Here are a few strategies you can try to help shift your body's internal clock and improve your sleep:\r\rGradually adjust your bedtime: Instead of trying to go to sleep at a specific time, try gradually shifting your bedtime earlier by 15-30 minutes each night until you reach your desired bedtime. This can help your body slowly adjust to the new schedule.\r\rKeep a consistent sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help your body get into a regular rhythm.\r\rCreate a bedtime routine: Establish a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath or reading a book, to help you wind down before sleep.\r\rAvoid screens before bedtime: The blue light emitted by screens can disrupt your body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin, so try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.\r\rGet some sunlight during the day: Exposure to sunlight during the day can help regulate your body's internal clock.

She was in the hospital for a long time but they discharged her. She is still in pain, please help. I attached the notes of her discharge.The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read aswithin normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Internal medicine doc here but in my differential is Adult Onset Stills Disease which can still present in children and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.

It's understandable that you may feel anxious about going to the dentist, but seeking dental care is important for maintaining good oral health and overall well-being.\rIn Australia, there are a few options available for low-cost or no-cost dental care, depending on your circumstances. Here are some suggestions:\r1.\tMedicare: If you have a Medicare card, you may be eligible for the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) General Dental Scheme, which covers some dental services for children and adults with a disability, medical condition, or certain other circumstances. You can check your eligibility and find out more about the MBS General Dental Scheme by visiting the Medicare website or speaking with a Medicare representative.\r2.\tPublic dental clinics: Many states and territories in Australia operate public dental clinics that provide low-cost or no-cost dental care to eligible individuals, such as those with low incomes, children, and seniors. You can contact your local public dental clinic to find out if you are eligible and to make an appointment.\r3.\tPrivate dental care with payment plans: If you are not eligible for the MBS General Dental Scheme or public dental clinics, you may be able to seek dental care at a private practice. Some private practices offer payment plans or financing options to help make treatment more affordable. You can ask about these options when you make an appointment.\rWhen you go to the dentist, you will generally be asked to fill out a medical history form and then be seen by the dentist for an examination. The dentist will assess your oral health and discuss any treatment recommendations with you. You can ask about the cost of treatment and payment options before proceeding with any treatment. It's also a good idea to discuss any concerns or questions you have with the dentist.\rI hope this information is helpful.

My parents nor siblings didn't do it, siblings and myself were never taught. By the time I started the damage was already done and getting worse. My front right tooth is decaying and I have a gap where my second to front left tooth should be, where there was a baby tooth that fell out when I was about 21. I've obviously never had nice teeth and I've always been extremely self-conscious about it.What are my options going forward? Can anyone explain the process of going to a dentist? Do you tell them what you want to do before the appointment? Do they have set prices? Im in a tough spot financially so I'm scared of getting a higher than anticipated bill.

Just want to add that itÛªs extremely common for people to be nervous about going to the dentist, especially if you havenÛªt been often. Dentists know this, and should be supportive throughout. You can let them know that you are nervous or that you havenÛªt seen a dentist recently. You should be able to phone local dentists and discuss with reception what the pricing is for a regular check up. At your first appointment they can explain what other treatments they recommend and how much they cost. Its hard to find free dental care in Aus, but clinics will have different prices, and they can give you that information before your appointment. I think itÛªs great that you want to see a dentist and have your teeth looked at.

My front right tooth is decaying and I have a gap where my second to front left tooth should be, where there was a baby tooth that fell out when I was about 21. I've obviously never had nice teeth and I've always been extremely self-conscious about it.What are my options going forward? Can anyone explain the process of going to a dentist? Do you tell them what you want to do before the appointment? Do they have set prices? Im in a tough spot financially so I'm scared of getting a higher than anticipated bill. I'm confused by the whole process. I've only been to a dentist once as an adult when I had sepsis from an infected wisdom tooth thus don't really remember the experience. Please help. Any advice is welcome.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: I agree with some of the advice that others have given already! Just want to add that itÛªs extremely common for people to be nervous about going to the dentist, especially if you havenÛªt been often. Dentists know this, and should be supportive throughout. You can let them know that you are nervous or that you havenÛªt seen a dentist recently. You should be able to phone local dentists and discuss with reception what the pricing is for a regular check up. At your first appointment they can explain what other treatments they recommend and how much they cost. Its hard to find free dental care in Aus, but clinics will have different prices, and they can give you that information before your appointment. I think itÛªs great that you want to see a dentist and have your teeth looked at. Good luck OP!Edit: This website has info about public dental services if you are based in NSW:\nmodel\n###Empathetic Response:",

        "ChatGPT Response": "It appears that the PET scan has shown some changes in certain lymph nodes in your body. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures found throughout your body that help to filter out harmful substances and fight infection. In the context of cancer, lymph nodes can sometimes become involved in the spread of cancer cells from the original tumor site to other parts of the body.\rThe first finding mentioned in the results is a calcified left hilar lymph node that is unchanged in size from a previous exam. This means that there is a small, hard mass of tissue in the left hilar region (an area near the center of your chest) that has not changed in size since it was last seen. The calcification suggests that the tissue has undergone some sort of hardening process. The fact that this lymph node was not previously hypermetabolic (meaning it did not show high levels of metabolic activity on a previous scan) but now has a maximum SUV (standardized uptake value, which is a measure of how much radioactivity is taken up by the tissue) of 5.3 suggests that there may be something going on with this lymph node that was not present before, and that further evaluation is needed to determine whether this is a metastasis (spread) of cancer cells.\rThe second finding mentioned in the results is an improvement in the size, extent, and hypermetabolic activity of retroperitoneal adenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum, which is the area behind the abdominal cavity). This is generally considered a positive finding, as it suggests that the chemotherapy you received may have been effective in reducing the size and activity of these lymph nodes.\rThe third finding mentioned in the results is the absence of any other suspected areas of metastatic disease. This means that, aside from the left hilar lymph node mentioned above, there are no other areas in your body that appear to be involved with the spread of cancer cells.\rIt's important to note that PET scans can be highly sensitive tests, and can sometimes pick up small changes that may not necessarily be clinically significant. It's also important to keep in mind that the results of a single scan should not be taken in isolation, but rather should be considered in the context of all of your medical history and the results of other tests and exams. It's best to discuss the results of your PET scan with your oncologist, who will be able to provide more information and context based on your specific case. I hope this helps to provide some clarity on the results of your scan.",

Explanation of scan would be helpful. 27M - 6Ûª7Û, 225lbs. White. Generally healthy before cancer. Bad at Reddit format. Diagnosed with stage 3 seminoma in July of this year. Had surgery and did four rounds of etoposide and cisplatin as chemotherapy. Seminoma did not present physically, only presentation was severe back pain. I have had other back issues so I lived in pain for close to a year. Went to oncologist per ER referral and Ultrasound confirmed seminoma. I got a pet scan today after completing chemo last week. I was very optimistic and my doctor has given me no reason to suspect there would be any problems. He said 95% sure chemo would take care of it. I am going to paste the results that were posted on my patient portal below. I am a big boy and a logical thinker please DonÛªt sugar coat theses results, translate and explain if possible. I was expecting good news but I can tell this is not. I can have peace if I understand it. My follow up with my oncologist is not until next week and IÛªm very anxious and want to understand. Begin Results:ÛÓÛÓÛÓÛÓ-:Impression:1.Hypermetabolic left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam. Calcification present. Metastatic disease cannot be excluded as this node was not hypermetabolic on prior exam. 2. Much improvement in retroperitoneal adenopathy in both size of lymph nodes, extent of lymph nodes, and decrease in hypermetabolic activity compared to prior exam. 3. No other areas of metastatic disease suspected.Findings:1. There is a calcified left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam probably about 1 cm in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV today of 5.3 and previously not hypermetabolic maximum activity 2.0.2.  The previously noted large intra-aortocaval lymph node has markedly decreased in size and on today's exam is subcentimeter in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV of 6.8 whereas previously maximum SUV was 16.6.3.  More inferiorly in the intra-aortocaval region of the retroperitoneum where multiple previous adjacent hypermetabolic lymph nodes were seen with a maximum SUV of 20.8, on today's exam 1 lymph node measuring roughly 8 mm in short axis measurement is present maximum SUV 6.8.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: A PET scan obtained right after finishing chemotherapy increases the likelihood of false positive results. It takes time for your body to clean up after chemotherapy or surgery or radiation. The residual activity that a PET scan captures in the active areas can take a few months to calm down. The presence of hypermetabolic areas is not unexpected when it was only a week since your last treatment. The fact that the areas of activity noted on prior scans are now smaller is good news. It strongly suggests that your cancer is responding to treatment. The new spot in your chest (the hilar node) may or may not be significant. There are other things that can cause a node to light up on PET scan. The presence of calcifications in a node is usually an indication of benign causes, rather than malignant causes of hypermetabolic activity. The only way to know for sure is a biopsy, which they probably won't recommend right now. Note: I am not an oncologist. Talk to your doctor about the results and the plan for follow-up.

Info: 25M, 5'9\", 180 pounds, no meds, no smoking, no previous medical issues.I've been having intermittent testicular area pain for the past 3 days. It's a quick sharp pain that's mostly happening on the left testicle area. Pain scale 6/10. Pain comes around every 2 minutes.

So, on September 17 I (21F) had an unprovoked, tonic clonic seizure. The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which IÛªve never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and i was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasnÛªt fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadnÛªt opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I know its not. IÛªve fainted a handful of times in my life and itÛªs never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didnÛªt know i was supposed to go to the ER, because I didnÛªt realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just wonÛªt believe me and said i just fainted. So i feel discouraged.Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and itÛªs making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I donÛªt want to find out itÛªs too late if I donÛªt do anything, but my family has always treated me as if iÛªm faking illnesses, even though i never have and have never been dramatic in any way. please help. iÛªm still on their insurance, so thatÛªs why itÛªs important.thank you.TLDR: F21 has unprovoked, first TC seizure 09/17.

However, there are some things you can try to help her understand the dangers of the substances she is considering using:\r1.\tEncourage her to speak with her medical team: It's important that she has the opportunity to ask her doctors and other medical professionals any questions or concerns she may have about her treatment plan. They can provide reliable information and address any myths or misinformation she may have come across.\r2.\tOffer to help her find reputable sources of information: There is a lot of false or misleading information available online, and it can be overwhelming to try to sort through it all. Offer to help your mom find reliable sources of information, such as reputable cancer organizations or peer-reviewed medical journals.\r3.\tShow her the evidence: If your mom is open to hearing more about the dangers of the substances she is considering using, try to provide her with evidence from credible sources. For example, you can show her research studies or articles from reputable medical organizations that demonstrate the risks of using these substances.\r4.\tEmphasize the importance of following her treatment plan: It's important for your mom to understand that her treatment plan has been carefully developed by her medical team to give her the best chance of a positive outcome. Emphasize the importance of following the treatment plan as recommended by her doctors.\r5.\tSeek support for yourself: Caring for a loved one with cancer can be emotionally and physically draining.

Thankfully she has started treatment with oral medicine and will start Xgeva injections at her next visit, but she still says that she does not trust the doctors fully. During our first visit to the doctor she told him that she wanted to treat her cancer in a more \"natural way\". Earlier today she asked me for my paypal password, which i had no problem with. I didn't really question it, but I then got emailed receipts from purchases that she had made. She used my account to buy Black Slave and Sodium Chorite (which she will use to make MMS or a \"Miracle Mineral Supplement\"). The doctor had told us that her cancer was quite close to the skin and I am aware that she may have a skin lesion there, and i know she will be using Black Salve to 'cure' the skin lesion. I also searched up the \"miracle\" mineral supplement, and it is something that conspiracy theorists promote as an end all be all cure to seemingly every illness ranging from cancer and HIV to COVID-19 and the common flu. I have just contacted paypal to cancel the payments and I hope she never gets a hold of them.I have tried telling her and showing her images of how harmful these substances are to the human body but she doesn't believe me and just brushes me off and i don't know what to do.. Just now when i tried talking to her about why using these would be a bad idea, i noticed that she was reading something about MMS on her computer.

I imagine her doctors aren't giving her very positive and hopeful outlooks and are probably telling her that there's no treatment that they can offer to save her life. Alternatively, there are stories on the internet filled with hope about MMS and other naturopathic/homeopathic remedies.People who have just been broken by a diagnosis like this often aren't using logic to make decisions, they use emotions.

        "ChatGPT Response": "I understand that you may be feeling overwhelmed and confused about vaccines, especially with all the conflicting information and strong anti-vaccine views in your family. It's important to remember that vaccines are a proven and effective way to protect ourselves and others from serious and potentially life-threatening diseases.\rFirst of all, it's important to know that vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and evaluation before they are approved for use, and they are continuously monitored for safety once they are in use. The vast majority of people who receive vaccines experience no serious side effects, and any side effects that do occur are usually mild and go away quickly on their own.\rVaccines work by helping the body develop immunity to a particular disease. When you get a vaccine, your body produces an immune response to the vaccine, which helps it to recognize and fight off the disease if you are exposed to it in the future. This means that if you get vaccinated, you are less likely to get sick from a particular disease and, if you do get sick, your symptoms will likely be milder.\rIt's also important to consider the impact of vaccines on the wider community. When more people in a community are vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, which helps to protect those who are unable to receive certain vaccines due to age, underlying health conditions, or other factors. This is especially important for protecting vulnerable populations, such as young children, elderly people, and those with compromised immune systems.\rGiven the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is especially important to consider getting vaccinated against the virus. While it is true that some people who contract COVID-19 have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, the virus can be severe and even deadly for others, especially those who are older or have underlying health conditions. Getting vaccinated not only helps to protect you from getting sick, but it also helps to slow the spread of the virus and bring the pandemic under control.\rI understand that it can be difficult to make decisions about your health when you are feeling depressed, but I encourage you to consider seeking help for your depression and to take steps to take care of yourself. This might include seeking support from a mental health professional, talking to a trusted friend or family member, or finding healthy ways to manage your stress and emotions.\rIn terms of getting vaccinated, it's important to remember that you are an adult now and have the right to make decisions about your own health. You can talk to a healthcare provider or visit a vaccination center to learn more about the vaccines that are available to you and to get the information and support you need to make an informed decision.",

While I can't diagnose your niece's condition or provide specific medical advice, I can provide some general information about stomach pain in children.\rIt's not uncommon for children to experience stomach pain from time to time, and the cause can vary. In some cases, stomach pain can be related to an infection or illness, such as a cold or the flu. It could also be caused by indigestion, constipation, or other digestive issues. In rare cases, stomach pain could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as appendicitis or inflammatory bowel disease.\rIf your niece's stomach pain persists or becomes severe, it may be a good idea for your sister to seek further medical attention. It's also important to watch for other symptoms that may indicate a more serious problem, such as severe abdominal swelling, vomiting, fever, or difficulty passing stool.\rIn the meantime, it might be helpful for your sister to try to identify any factors that seem to trigger or worsen your niece's stomach pain, and to keep track of when the pain occurs and how long it lasts. This information can be helpful for the doctor to understand the possible cause of the pain.\rIt's also important to continue giving your niece the erythromycin as prescribed, and to make sure she stays well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the hand, becomes compressed at the wrist. This can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers.\rThere are a number of other factors that can cause these symptoms as well, such as nerve irritation or injury, muscle strain or overuse, or inflammation in the wrist or hand. It's also possible that the numbness and tingling could be related to your other medical issues, such as anemia or generalized anxiety disorder.\rIn order to determine the cause of your symptoms and get an accurate diagnosis, it would be best to see a doctor. They can perform a physical examination and may order additional tests, such as nerve conduction studies or imaging tests, to help determine the cause of your symptoms.\rIn the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help alleviate your symptoms:\r1.\tTake breaks from activities that involve repetitive hand or wrist movements, such as using a computer or phone for long periods of time.\r2.\tUse good posture and ergonomic techniques when using a computer or other devices.\r3.\tAvoid sleeping in positions that put pressure on your wrist or hand.\r4.\tTry using wrist splints or other supportive devices to help keep your wrist in a neutral position.\r5.\tAvoid activities that involve gripping or squeezing for long periods of time.\r6.\tTry gentle stretches or exercises to help improve flexibility and strength in your wrist and hand.\rIt's important to remember that self-diagnosis is not always accurate and that it's always best to see a doctor for a proper evaluation and treatment plan.",

Inhaling marijuana smoke may worsen heart and anxiety problems and may also exacerbate any existing health issues you may have.\r\rResearch suggests that marijuana smoke contains many of the same toxins, irritants, and carcinogens found in tobacco smoke, and inhaling these substances can harm the respiratory system and increase the risk of lung infections and other respiratory problems.

Your healthcare provider can help you understand the potential effects of marijuana smoke on your health and can provide guidance on how to manage your health concerns.\r\rTo discuss this issue with your healthcare provider, you can describe your symptoms and concerns and provide any relevant information about your exposure to marijuana smoke.

Your healthcare provider can assess your symptoms, medical history, and overall health to determine the most appropriate course of action. This may include ordering tests to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms or providing recommendations for managing your health and preventing future illnesses.\r\rIt is important to take care of your physical and mental health by eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of rest, exercising regularly, and managing stress. Taking these steps can help support your immune system and may help reduce your risk of getting sick.",

Here are a few recommendations that may help:\r\rKeep the wound clean and covered: It's important to keep the wound clean and covered to prevent infection and further injury. You can use a liquid bandage or a finger-shaped gauze to cover the stitches, and secure it in place with tape such as kino tape.\r\rAvoid activities that put a lot of strain on the stitches: While it's okay to do some light training, it's important to avoid activities that put a lot of strain on the stitches. This might include activities that involve gripping or gripping heavy objects, as well as activities that cause sweating, as this can loosen the tape or gauze and expose the stitches.\r\rUse padding: If you need to do activities that involve gripping or using your injured finger, you can try using padding around the finger to provide some protection for the stitches. You can use foam or a soft material to pad the finger, and secure it in place with tape.\r\rTalk to your doctor: If you're unsure about what activities are safe to do with your stitches, it's always a good idea to talk to your doctor. They can provide specific recommendations based on your injury and the type of stitches you have.\r\rOverall, it's important to protect your stitches and allow your finger to heal properly. If you're concerned about the impact on your training, you can try modifying your training routine or working with a coach or trainer to find alternative exercises that don't put too much strain on your stitches.",

No blood though, or any serious stomach pains which I read is a possible symptom of colon cancer. This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere? Besides this though, I've been feeling more tired than normal. I'm an avid coffee drinker so I tried more coffee and that didn't help. No coffee at all, and I felt exactly the same somehow.

However, herpes lesions can also be smaller and less noticeable, and may not always be accompanied by other symptoms. It's important to note that herpes can be transmitted even when there are no visible sores present, so it's important to use protection during sexual activity to reduce the risk of transmission.\r\rThrush, also known as candidiasis, is a fungal infection caused by the yeast Candida.

Whenever my BF drink any amounts of alcohol, heÛªll end up throwing up and sometimes its excessively. For example, I once watched him drink one IPA and he was throwing up an hour later. If he drinks anything with hard liqour in it, heÛªll end up throwing up all night and heÛªll have to go to the ER because he canÛªt hold anything down at all. HeÛªs fine drinking pretty light beers like a Modelo or a Budweiser but anything stronger and heÛªs throwing up. At first I thought it was because of excessive drinking but itÛªs now after a couple of beers or one beer in total. Is this due to alcohol intolerance?

It is difficult to provide a definitive answer about the likelihood of your mother's survival, as multiple organ failure can be a very serious condition with a high mortality rate. However, it is important to note that the prognosis can vary significantly depending on the underlying cause of the organ failure and the overall health of the individual.\r\rMultiple organ failure is a condition that occurs when two or more organs in the body begin to malfunction or fail. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, trauma, and underlying medical conditions such as cancer or autoimmune diseases.\r\rThe survival rate for multiple organ failure can depend on a number of factors, including the severity of the organ failure, the underlying cause of the organ failure, and the overall health of the individual. In general, the survival rate for multiple organ failure is lower than for single organ failure.\r\rIt is important to note that multiple organ failure can be a very serious and life-threatening condition, and early diagnosis and treatment are critical to improving the chances of survival. If your mother is receiving appropriate medical care and treatment, it is possible that she may recover and her organs may begin to function normally again. However, it is also important to be prepared for the possibility that her condition may not improve, and to consider the options available for supportive care in the event that her condition deteriorates.",

        "ChatGPT Response": "It can be useful to track certain biomarkers before and after a water fast to get a sense of the physiological changes that occur during the fast. Some biomarkers that you may want to consider asking for when you make your appointment at the lab include:\r\rComplete blood count (CBC): This test measures the number and types of cells in your blood, including red and white blood cells and platelets. During a water fast, you may see changes in your white blood cell count, which can provide information about your immune system function.\r\rElectrolytes: This test measures the levels of electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, and chloride) in your blood. Electrolytes play a crucial role in maintaining proper fluid balance in your body, and changes in electrolyte levels can occur during a water fast.\r\rKidney function tests: These tests measure the levels of creatinine, urea, and other substances in your blood that can indicate how well your kidneys are functioning. Water fasting can put stress on your kidneys, so it may be helpful to track your kidney function during the fast.\r\rLiver function tests: These tests measure the levels of enzymes and other substances in your blood that can indicate how well your liver is functioning. Water fasting can put stress on your liver, so it may be helpful to track your liver function during the fast.\r\rLipid panel: This test measures the levels of cholesterol and other fats in your blood. A water fast may affect your lipid levels, so it can be useful to track them before and after the fast.\r\rC-reactive protein (CRP): This is a protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Tracking CRP levels before and after a water fast may provide insight into the effects of the fast on inflammation in the body.\r\rIt's important to note that the specific tests you should request may depend on your individual health needs and concerns. It's a good idea to discuss your fasting plans with your healthcare provider and ask for their recommendations for testing. They can help you determine which tests are most appropriate for you and can provide guidance on how to interpret the results.",

They can be painful and uncomfortable, and treatment may be necessary to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.\r\rTo drain a prolapsed hemorrhoid, a healthcare provider will typically perform a procedure called a hemorrhoidectomy. This involves removing the prolapsed hemorrhoid tissue through a surgical incision. The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the area around the anus so you don't feel pain during the procedure.\r\rIt's normal to feel anxious about having a surgical procedure, especially if you have chronic pain and other health conditions. It might be helpful to talk with your healthcare provider about your concerns and ask any questions you have about the procedure. They should be able to provide you with more information about what to expect and how to prepare for the procedure.\r\rIf you're experiencing back pain or stomach pain that is new and unrelated to your hemorrhoid, you should mention this to your healthcare provider. It's important to have any new or unexplained symptoms evaluated, as they could be a sign of a different health issue that needs to be addressed.\r\rI hope this information is helpful, and I wish you the best in managing your health concerns. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.",

It is understandable to be concerned about your health, especially after reading about the Seattle woman who passed away from the infection.

No issues with the pregnancy so far either.This additional ultrasound was performed because my doctor told me this pregnancy is considered a \"geriatric pregnancy\".The technician kept switching the transducer (?) and tried to get the baby to move more to be able to take better pictures. (\"The baby is not cooperative\" was what she said.)Baby was moving and normal heartbeat was measured. Technician printed pictures for me and congratulated me on the pregnancy.When my OBGYN called today he told me that unfortunately something seems to be wrong with the baby, and asked if I already heard anything from the technician who did the ultrasound (I told him I did not).He couldn't tell me what medical condition it was, he said that he had never seen this before, the only thing he could tell me was that we need another ultrasound next week to confirm, and that genetic specialists might have to talk to me.He said that there might have been something wrong with the ultrasound machine, but he sounded so negative on the phone that it made me feel like this pregnancy won't be able to continue. When I asked him to be more specific, he mentioned the following- Cavum Septum Pellucidum (CSP) not seen- Nasal Bone absent- Brain is normal size but couldn't see a cerebellumI googled the CSP and found sites that mentioned it would be difficult to locate before 18 weeks.I'm devastated right now and find it difficult being left with this information and having to wait for another week, that's why I'm seeking for advise here.How likely is it that the technician just did a bad job or the ultrasound was not clear enough at 12 weeks, especially considering that so many features seem to be absent on the ultrasound? If the features are absent on the next ultrasound, what genetic disorder does this indicate and should I come to terms with the fact that this pregnancy most likely has to be terminated?Anything experienced something similar before? Ultrasound image Thank you for your help.Edit: Thank you for all your input so far.I have asked for the report and it was sent to me.These are the things mentioned as abnormal:\"Choroid/skull: Abnormal. Head has a rounded appearance. Chloroid plexus appears abnormal. No cerebellum seen. Cavum septum pellucidum not identified.Abdominal wall/cord insertion: Abnormal. Omphalocele likely containing bowel just to the left of the cord insertion. Overall size measures approximately 8mm. There appears to be incomplete separation of the hemispheres with an apparent cortical defect.\"Everything else is listed as normal and nasal bone mentioned as identified; but then at the bottom of the report it sums up:\"Impression:Single live fetus at 11 weeks 6 days.Abnormal appearance head, cerebrum and cerebellum.Absent nasal bone. Omphalocele.\"\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: The ultrasound that is performed around 11-13 weeks of pregnancy is very important in order to detect certain abnormalities that can be seen early in pregnancy. The one image you have provided does not help a lot. However, absent nasal septum can be a worrying sign, although not always indicative of an actual problem with the fetus since it can be seen later in pregnancy. I have seen mothers with small noses have fetuses that looked like that on ultrasound but were born completely normal. Regarding the brain abnormalities, some cannot be seen clearly so early in pregnancy and some can be corrected later on. If absence of cerebellum is confirmed however, it can turn out to be a very serious condition for the newborn and can lead to severe developmental delay and neurological problems later in life. You should for sure have another ultrasound by a specialist in that field. You might need also further testing, e.g. amniocentesis to confirm. I don't want to sound extremely alarming but you should also think about the possibility of terminating such a pregnancy if severe abnormalities are confirmed.

IÛªm M/26, weigh about 115LB. had a headache come and go this whole week. I am gonna talk to my doctor about it tomorrow, but IÛªve been taking 2 500mg pills only once each day for the past week and a couple days for this headache. I am worried if I take two more tonight I will add to possible ÛÏmedication overuse headachesÛ or even liver damage.**Surely IÛªll be fine because IÛªm not surpassing even half the maximum daily dose. But my concern is how many days in a row IÛªm using it and how IÛªm a pretty light, skinny male so the max dose is probably smaller for me idk if thatÛªs even how that works? Can anybody fill me in on the safety of taking 1000mg for more than 10 days?** The headache is probably coming from using my phone, playing video games, and watching YouTube on my laptop practically nonstop from wake to bedtime only with brief breaks in between. IÛªm addicted to technology and also IÛªm really stressed about a breakup and my own quality of life these days. IÛªm unemployed and idle due to poor mental health so surely itÛªs from all the overwhelm and using technology as a constant distraction from the struggle.. I hope. I have health anxiety and hope itÛªs not cancer or something else. But for now I just want this pain to go away. Let me know if I can take another two 500mg this week, the first of today without freaking about about damage to my body. Thanks\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: You could do that for a long time.

It's always important to have any new or unusual skin changes checked by a dermatologist, especially if they have unusual characteristics such as asymmetry, irregular borders, uneven color, or a diameter larger than a pencil eraser. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to potential skin cancers.\r\rIt's great that you were able to get an appointment with a dermatologist quickly. The dermatologist will be able to examine the growth and determine the best course of action. If the growth is found to be a cherry angioma, as the dermatologist suspected, it is a benign (non-cancerous) vascular tumor that can be safely removed if desired. If the growth is found to be malignant, further treatment will be necessary to remove the cancer and potentially prevent its spread.\r\rIt's always important to take good care of your skin and to protect it from excessive sun exposure, as sun exposure is a major risk factor for skin cancer. Wearing protective clothing, including a hat and sunglasses, and using sunscreen with a high SPF can help to protect your skin from harmful UV rays.",

        "ChatGPT Response": "A holter monitor is a device that continuously records the electrical activity of your heart for a 24-hour period. The results of the holter monitor test are typically analyzed by a healthcare professional, such as a cardiologist, to determine whether there are any abnormalities in the rhythm or functioning of your heart.\r\rIn your case, the conclusion of the holter monitor test indicates that you have a normal sinus rhythm, which means that the electrical signals that coordinate your heartbeats are coming from the sinoatrial (SA) node, the natural pacemaker of the heart, and are happening at a normal rate. The results also indicate that you have rare supraventricular ectopic activity, which means that you have occasional extra heartbeats that originate from the atria or the atrioventricular (AV) node, rather than from the SA node. These extra heartbeats are also known as premature atrial contractions (PACs). PACs are relatively common and are usually not a cause for concern. They may be triggered by factors such as caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, stress, or lack of sleep, but they can also occur in people who are otherwise healthy.\r\rThe results also show that you do not have any ventricular ectopic activity, which means that you do not have any extra heartbeats originating from the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart. This is good news, as ventricular ectopic activity can be a sign of a more serious heart condition.\r\rFinally, the results indicate that your symptoms did not correlate with any dysrhythmia, which means that any symptoms you were experiencing, such as palpitations or shortness of breath, did not appear to be related to any abnormal heart rhythm.\r\rIn summary, the results of your holter monitor test indicate that you have a normal sinus rhythm and that you have rare supraventricular ectopic activity, which is not uncommon and is usually not a cause for concern. It is always a good idea to discuss the results of any medical test with your healthcare provider, so you may want to ask your doctor for more information or clarification about your test results.",

        "ChatGPT Response": "It sounds like you had an episode that could potentially be a seizure or a case of vasovagal syncope (fainting). Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of fainting, and it is typically triggered by a specific event or condition, such as standing for a long time, seeing blood, or experiencing emotional stress. Seizures, on the other hand, are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and can manifest in a variety of ways, including convulsions, loss of consciousness, and loss of bladder control.\r\rGiven that you have a history of fainting during blood draws, your primary care doctor may have assumed that your episode was vasovagal syncope. However, the fact that you had convulsions and lost bladder control during this episode raises the possibility that it could have been a seizure. It is important to rule out other potential causes, such as a cardiac or neurological issue, in order to determine the most appropriate treatment.\r\rI would recommend following the recommendations of the ER doctor and undergoing the recommended workups, such as a neurological and cardiac evaluation. This will help to determine the cause of your episode and ensure that you receive the most appropriate treatment. It is always better to be safe rather than sorry, and undergoing these tests can help to ensure that any underlying medical issues are properly diagnosed and treated.",

        "ChatGPT Response": "It sounds like you have been experiencing a number of concerning symptoms, including fainting episodes, vertigo, and difficulty speaking and moving after waking up. It is important that you continue to follow up with your healthcare provider to address these issues and determine the cause.\r\rBased on the information you provided, it sounds like your healthcare provider has already ruled out epilepsy as the cause of your fainting episodes and has instead diagnosed you with vasovagal syncope and possibly POTS syndrome. Vasovagal syncope is a type of fainting that occurs when the body overreacts to certain triggers, such as standing for a long time or experiencing strong emotions, and the heart rate and blood pressure drop suddenly. POTS syndrome is a condition in which the heart rate increases significantly upon standing up, leading to symptoms such as lightheadedness, fainting, and fatigue.\r\rIn addition to your EEG, which is a test that measures brain activity, there may be other tests that your healthcare provider may recommend to further evaluate your symptoms and determine the cause. For example, they may recommend a tilt table test, which is a test that helps to determine if your fainting episodes are due to a problem with the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. They may also recommend other tests such as an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, or a Holter monitor, which is a device that records heart activity for a period of time.\r\rIt is also important to consider whether there are any triggers or factors that may be contributing to your fainting episodes. For example, if you have been experiencing vertigo, it may be helpful to avoid activities that may exacerbate this symptom, such as looking up or down for a long time or standing for extended periods of time. If you have been diagnosed with POTS syndrome, your healthcare provider may recommend lifestyle modifications such as increasing your fluid and salt intake, avoiding prolonged standing or sitting, and avoiding certain medications that may worsen your symptoms.\r\rIn the meantime, it is important that you take care of yourself and prioritize your health. If you are experiencing any symptoms that are concerning or that interfere with your daily activities, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider as soon as possible.

[23F, Hispanic, 131 lbs, recently diagnosed with vertigo, Vasovagal syncope, and possibly POTS Syndrome, primary issue has happened over the course of the past week or so]So, IÛªm feeling very overwhelmed here. IÛªve never been diagnosed with epilepsy. IÛªve had doctors toss around the idea of ÛÏabsence seizuresÛ when I would have spells of zoning out over the past few years. I also used to faint randomly. That stopped for a few years. Fast forward to this week, IÛªm having issues again; but worse-Monday: I went to the ER because IÛªve been getting some messed up vertigo symptoms. I felt very off. They told me the vertigo was related to my bp &amp; hr dropping and going up upon position changes (think they mentioned POTS?)Tuesday night: I pass out at home after feeling light headed for a while. This time (unlike times in previous years) I am out, unconscious on the floor. When I wake up I get told my eyes were fluttering and I wasnÛªt responding. I was out maybe 3 minutes. I still had trouble speaking after waking up.Wednesday morning: I got to work, my head was killing me in one specific spot in the back of my head for a few hours. Pain started to get intense, started getting heart palpitations, light headed was returns- BOOM, hit the ground - unconscious yet again. One of my co-workers found me, I wasnÛªt responding and I was randomly twitching. My eyes were open but fluttering again. He called an ambulance and once the medics got there (literally within 2 minutes) they tried to wake me up but I wasnÛªt responding still. I was in and out by this point but I couldnÛªt speak or move. I heard him say my eyes were all over the place, next thing I knew he was digging his knuckles into my sternum and that mostly got me conscious again. When I opened my eyes I was dead confused and felt like I was about to slip out again. They brought me to the hospital and the doctor was ready to chalk it up to a migraine until it happened again while she was right next to me. Then she decided I needed to be seen by neurology and I was admitted. While I waited a few hours for neurology, the nurses noticed my eyes, tried to wake me up but I was again unable to speak or move. More knuckles into my sternum.They got a rush order for an EEG (still took a few hours to get) but they only did it for about 35 mins and that was with breaks because I had to keep using the bathroom. Once the test was done and read- they said it came back normal and that it was not seizures. I was told it was Vasovagal syncope + vertigo and potentially POTS Syndrome. Friday: took day off from work to rest as I felt off still. Today at work: started to get odd sensation in back of my head like a tickle or skin crawling feeling almost that moved into back of my neck. Started to feel a bit of twitchiness. Feeling got more intense in my head and I felt myself checking out again. My co worker made sure I was safe and tried to wake me up. He said my eyes again were all over the place and fluttery, and this time I was super twitchy. He had to give me a few minutes after I was awake again because I still couldnÛªt speak right after.  I just got a notification that the EEG report posted to my portal so I looked at it (even though I am aware I was told it was normal). I read it, it says ÛÏNo epileptiform abnormalities are appreciatedÛ(I.e-normal), but in the beginning of the report itÛªs says ÛÏsubsequently witnessed to have episode of R head turn and unresponsiveness c/f seizure.Û I know IÛªm not a doctor, I have no clue about any of this, but I feel like I need medication. My body feels SO exhausted after every episode and itÛªs draining me.I just need to know what the hell is going on or what I should do. IÛªm also taking a break from driving for now to be safe. IÛªm seriously at a loss. It keeps happening and I keep feeling specific things before it happens. Please shed ANY light on this. I have a child to chase around and need to get better.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: These are atypical symptoms and while I've learned anything can be seizure it can also be other things.- I'd try my best to keep hydrated, alongside a high salt diet for now to see whether that gets you feeling better. If this helps, would be suggestive of POTS or vasovagal spells (you can youtube \"the fainting lark\" for examples of passing out that look like seizures).- agree with not driving for now just in case, as you seem exhausted regardless, even if these aren't seizures- consider requesting an ambulatory eeg via a neurologist or your doc. You'd essentially just wear an eeg for several days, and since you have these spells frequently, are likely to get an answer - empiric seizure med could also be tried.

        "ChatGPT Response": "T-wave inversion on an electrocardiogram (ECG) refers to a specific pattern in the shape of the T wave, which is a small deflection on the ECG tracing that follows the QRS complex. T-wave inversion can be a normal finding in some individuals, particularly in certain leads (V1-V4) in young, healthy individuals. However, T-wave inversion can also be seen in individuals who have had a heart attack, as you mentioned.\r\rThe cause of T-wave inversion in individuals who have had a heart attack is typically due to scarring of the heart muscle that occurs after a heart attack. The scar tissue does not conduct electrical impulses as well as normal heart muscle, which can result in abnormal ECG findings, including T-wave inversion.\r\rT-wave inversion can also occur in individuals who have not had a heart attack and may be a normal finding in some individuals. This is more commonly seen in young, healthy individuals, particularly in leads V1-V4. In these individuals, the cause of T-wave inversion is not well understood, but it is thought to be related to the electrical activity of the heart in these individuals.\r\rIt is important to note that T-wave inversion on an ECG can have multiple causes and is not always indicative of a heart problem. It is important to discuss the findings of your ECG with your healthcare provider, as they will be able to consider your medical history and other factors in determining the cause of your T-wave inversion and any necessary treatment.",

It was on the bottom, the top, multiple places at once. And a very tight spot in the exact middle of my chest. It started off small sharp pains intermittently. Then became overwhelming and I couldnÛªt breathe too deep or it would hurt beyond words. Over the next hour it became increasingly more intense. I was simply sitting in bed and I could not get it to calm down. Then around 11:45 pm, I was trying to sleep but it hurt worse to lay down. It became unbearable, it radiated up my neck and into my face. My lower left jaw hurt to move and it was tight around my left cheek. I developed a headache but still didnÛªt think much of it because for the past week I had been dealing with my face going numb on my left side. By this point my boyfriend was freaking out because I was gasping and shaking. It hurt too much to cry. He started googling things and told me he thinks IÛªm having a heart attack. I told him no way, IÛªm only 19. He kept telling me we needed to go to the hospital. But IÛªll admit, IÛªm stubborn. I have medical trauma and just convinced it was a very strange panic attack. I could have swore this was just caused by some other health issue I have (I have Asthma, Arthritis, and Celiacs Disease) It finally cooled down around 1am and I was okay enough to lay down and sleep. But he keeps persisting that I could have had a ÛÏsilentÛ heart attack. That we should have went to the hospital, I could have d*ed, etc. IÛªm at work today and I still donÛªt feel the best and heÛªs asking me to go to the hospital.

It is important to follow the recommended dosage instructions and to not take acetaminophen for longer than directed.\r\rIf you are concerned about the potential negative effects of taking acetaminophen every night, it may be helpful to discuss your sleep concerns with a healthcare professional. They may be able to suggest alternative ways to improve your sleep, such as using relaxation techniques, adjusting your sleep environment, or trying over-the-counter or prescription sleep aids. It is always important to follow the advice of a healthcare professional when it comes to your health.",

The thyroid is a gland in the neck that produces hormones that regulate metabolism, heart rate, and body temperature.\r\rIt's unusual for someone under the age of 30 to have an abnormal TSH level, but it is possible. It's important to follow up with your doctor and have the retest as directed to determine the cause of the abnormal TSH level and to determine the appropriate treatment.\r\rThere are several potential causes of an abnormal TSH level, including problems with the thyroid gland itself, problems with the pituitary gland (which regulates the thyroid), or the use of certain medications. It's also possible that the abnormal TSH level is due to a temporary condition, such as stress or illness.\r\rIt's not clear from your description whether your psoriasis or your indoor lifestyle are contributing to your abnormal TSH level. It's important to discuss these and any other potential contributing factors with your doctor, who can help determine the cause of the abnormal TSH level and recommend the appropriate treatment.\r\rIn the meantime, it's important to continue following your treatment plan for your psoriasis and to continue eating a healthy diet that includes a variety of protein sources. It's also a good idea to try to get some sunlight exposure, as sunlight is important for the production of vitamin D, which is important for bone health and immune system function.",

I've tried therapy a few times but it seems to barely help, especially considering how it helped before. I've greatly adapted to using only one hand for everything possible and it infuriates me when I have to admit that I need help with something that anyone else can do. Would I be a possible candidate for a prosthetic arm and hand? I'm so terrified that everything I do with just my left hand will cause it to wear out quicker than average.

For 2-3 years now i have had a very low pulse imo. In the beginnig of this i didnt eat much and i went from 86kg down to 55kg, because of health anxiety. Im much better now. Im not super athletic at all, i only go for 1-2 walks a day for 1 hour +. I dont work atm and im usually at home. Last BP was 130/66. I had 2 ECGs in july, they were good. So, i can have a full blown panick attack and my pulse will still be like 46-60 and i breathe very slow, feels like i cant \"normally\" breathe faster. My pulse increases when i stand and when i walk etc and ive had like 166 when walking up a hill, i never get tired, and i walk fast. Peak Flow Meter is 500-600 and my Spo2 is always 97-99%. The problem is that it just feels so weak and slow when im wide awake and have panick attacks, shouldnt it go up when im like that, and hyperventilate? Im the complete opposite. My doc told me its alright, i have been there several times, and my heart and lungs sounds fine. She told me that i had no need to go to a cardiologist unless i started passing out occasionally etc. Why is it like this? Am i just in better shape then i think? The anxiety one is just weird for me. I have GERD and alot of muscle tension throughout my body. Im usually not dizzy when i have low pulse, i feel alright, just scared and anxious about it. Been hard to breathe these 3 years but always normal Spo2. Dont know what more info could be relevant.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Young, relatively healthy people commonly have low resting heart rates.

It's understandable to feel worried when you're experiencing unusual sensations or changes in your body.\n\nThe tingling sensation you're describing sounds like it's localized to the area of the cut and the surrounding skin. This is likely due to swelling and inflammation caused by the injury. While swelling can alter sensation in the skin, it's usually not dangerous unless it's severe.\n\nHowever, it's always best to consult with a doctor if you're concerned about any changes in your body or if the tingling sensation is bothersome. They can examine the wound and determine if there are any signs of infection or other complications.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some over-the-counter remedies to help reduce swelling and pain, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. You can also apply a cold compress to the area to help numb the sensation.\n\nI hope this response is more empathetic and understanding than the original response. I understand that you may be feeling scared and concerned about your injury, and I want to assure you that it's likely not a serious problem. However, it's always best",

Excessive saliva production, or sialorrhea, can be caused by a variety of factors, including neurological conditions, medications, and structural abnormalities in the mouth or throat.\r\rTreatment for sialorrhea depends on the underlying cause, and may involve medications, behavioral interventions, and/or surgical procedures.\r\rSome possible medications that may help to reduce saliva production include anticholinergic drugs (such as glycopyrrolate or scopolamine), beta blockers (such as propranolol or atenolol), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as fluoxetine or sertraline). However, it's important to note that these medications can have side effects, and it may take some trial and error to find the most effective and tolerable treatment for your son.\r\rBehavioral interventions, such as positioning your son in a way that allows gravity to help drain saliva away from his mouth, or using a chin-down posture, can also be helpful in managing sialorrhea. You may also want to try using absorbent materials, such as gauze or a bib, to help keep your son's face dry.\r\rIf your son's sialorrhea is due to a structural abnormality in his mouth or throat, such as a blockage or an anatomic abnormality, surgical intervention may be necessary. Botox injections into the salivary glands can also be an option in some cases, but as you mentioned, there can be serious side effects associated with this treatment.\r\rIt's important to work closely with your son's healthcare team to determine the most appropriate treatment for his sialorrhea.

He has no head control and is very much like a baby in terms of his activity and self care.  He has a GTube for feeding and receives nothing by mouth due to aspirating everything.  He constantly battles excess saliva.  A scope showed a constant stream of bubbly saliva all the way down his throat.  His tonsils are not large and all looks well functionally but itÛªs just a steady stream of bubbles.  We are constantly wiping his face and at night he coughs/gags and we use a suction machine with a little sucker attached to clear out his mouth and nose.  He previously was on Robinol to help halt the secretions but he had bad side effects and we stopped.  His ENT recommended a cough assist machine which we use but feel like it does nothing.  Another option we had discussed was Botox but weÛªre told there are some serious side effects with that as well.  We are looking for recommendations or advice on alternative treatments\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Botox is reasonable to trial to see if it would be helpful in reducing the symptoms. A more last resort option would be to remove a number of the major salivary glands to reduce saliva production.

He has no head control and is very much like a baby in terms of his activity and self care.  He has a GTube for feeding and receives nothing by mouth due to aspirating everything.  He constantly battles excess saliva.  A scope showed a constant stream of bubbly saliva all the way down his throat.  His tonsils are not large and all looks well functionally but itÛªs just a steady stream of bubbles.  We are constantly wiping his face and at night he coughs/gags and we use a suction machine with a little sucker attached to clear out his mouth and nose.  He previously was on Robinol to help halt the secretions but he had bad side effects and we stopped.  His ENT recommended a cough assist machine which we use but feel like it does nothing.  Another option we had discussed was Botox but weÛªre told there are some serious side effects with that as well.  We are looking for recommendations or advice on alternative treatments\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Botox is reasonable to trial to see if it would be helpful in reducing the symptoms. A more last resort option would be to remove a number of the major salivary glands to reduce saliva production. This would obviously be a decently extensive surgery which I'd argue has more side effects than botox.\nmodel\n###Empathetic Response:",

It's also possible that your girlfriend may not be aware of what an orgasm feels like because she has never had one before.\r\rOne thing you can try is to encourage your girlfriend to explore her own body and become more familiar with her own arousal and pleasure. This can be done through masturbation, which can help her better understand what feels good to her and what doesn't. It can also be helpful to have open and honest communication with your girlfriend about her pleasure and desires, and to be patient and supportive as she learns more about her own body and what feels good to her.\r\rIt's also important to remember that pleasure and intimacy in a relationship go beyond just achieving orgasm, and it's okay to enjoy intimacy and pleasure in other ways as well.

However, it's important to try to determine the cause of the bleeding so that it can be treated appropriately. Bleeding from the rectum or anus can have many different causes, some of which may be serious.\r\rThere are a few common causes of rectal bleeding that might be worth considering:\r\rHemorrhoids: Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus and rectum. They can cause itching, discomfort, and bleeding. Hemorrhoids are often caused by straining during bowel movements, sitting for long periods of time, or constipation.\r\rAnal fissures: Anal fissures are small tears in the skin around the anus. They can cause pain and bleeding, especially during bowel movements. Anal fissures are often caused by constipation or passing large or hard stools.\r\rInflammatory bowel disease: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of conditions that cause inflammation in the digestive tract. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two types of IBD. Both can cause rectal bleeding, as well as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other symptoms.\r\rOther possible causes: Other possible causes of rectal bleeding include anal cancer, rectal cancer, and rectal polyps.\r\rIt's important to see a doctor for an evaluation if you experience rectal bleeding. Your doctor will be able to determine the cause of the bleeding and recommend appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try to manage your symptoms by:\r\rDrinking plenty of fluids\rEating a high-fiber diet to help prevent constipation\rUsing over-the-counter creams or ointments to soothe the area\rAvoiding straining during bowel movements\rTaking warm baths to help relax the muscles in the anus\rIf you continue to experience rectal bleeding or have any other concerns, it's important to follow up with your doctor.",

I have a week left. My prefered average sleep is 5 hours. I struggle to wake up on schedule. For the time being (and no more) is it okay to use smelling salts to wake up on time? If my alarm goes off, I am concious, but I just go back to sleep. Can I use smelling salts to remedy this?\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: I mean, sure. They'll wake you up. The ideal is to get more sleep as this is likely your body telling you that you need more sleep and you may notice that lack of sleep affects your ability to think through some of these problems on exams.\nmodel\n###Empathetic Response:",

However, it is understandable that you are concerned about the potential side effects of antibiotics and the risk of developing Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection.\r\rIt is important to discuss your concerns with your surgeon and healthcare team. They can assess the specific risks and benefits of receiving antibiotics in your case and help you make an informed decision. It may be possible to use alternative infection prevention strategies, such as thorough skin preparation, sterilization of the surgical site, and use of sterile technique during the surgery.\r\rIt is also important to consider the type of surgery you are having and the potential risks of infection. Some surgeries, such as those involving the respiratory tract, bladder, or intestines, may be at higher risk for infection. Your surgeon can provide more information about the specific risks in your case and help you weigh the risks and benefits of receiving antibiotics.\r\rIf you decide not to receive antibiotics, it is important to take steps to reduce the risk of infection. These may include practicing good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently and keeping the surgical wound clean and dry. It may also be helpful to follow a healthy diet and get plenty of rest to support your immune system.\r\rIn summary, it is important to discuss your concerns about receiving antibiotics with your surgeon and healthcare team.

Taking Prozac 20mg, Wellbutrin 150mg, Propranolol prn. In 2013 (age 35) I got a cochlear implant in my right ear. All was going well until I started having facial twitching when wearing the device and shocks inside my head. After some back and forth with my clinic I decided to just stop using it and move on. Since then IÛªve had the following symptoms slowly grow worse or become more consistent. IÛªve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, slightly enlarged left thyroid, generalized fatigue/hypersomnia. I saw an ENT in Nov 2021 who felt a lump on the right side of my neck and had a CT done. My complaints and reason for seeing the ENT included headaches, neck pain, very visible asymmetrical swelling on my right neck/jawline, mild swallowing difficulties/chronic cough (IÛªve had a cough since 2019). These were the findings:2021 FINDINGS: No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the right parotid gland. No definite evidence of disproportionate enhancement, radiopaque calculi or ductal dilatation to the parotid gland on the right. Submandibular glands, muscles of mastication, tongue, floor of mouth, pharynx, larynx appear unremarkable. No definite enlarged lymph nodes within the neck. Few phleboliths noted within the palatine tonsils. Asymmetry in the size of the thyroid glands with the right appearing larger than the left. No definite CT evidence of a discrete nodule within the thyroid. Streak artifact coursing through the thyroid from the patient shoulders. Nasal septum deviated to the right with a prominent spur abutting the inferior turbinate. Paranasal sinuses appear unopacified. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity incompletely seen on this study. Partial opacification of the remaining inferior mastoid air cells. Prominent degenerative changes within the cervical spine most pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7. Mild to moderate neural foramina narrowing on the right  at C5-C6.IMPRESSION:1. No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the parotid gland.2. Mild nonspecific enlargement of the thyroid on the right relative to the left.3. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity._____________My ENT wrote ÛÏno discreet mass was noted. I think it was fullness of the SCM in that area you are feeling. Have a nice day!Û The doctor then rejected my request for a follow up appointment. I didnÛªt feel a lump, she did! I went in for neck pain and headaches and she found the lump. I wrote down everything IÛªve complained about in the last five years and finally made the connection this was all probably due to cochlear implant failure/migration. I donÛªt see the doctor frequently (why bother?) but when I do they give me more antidepressants. I had bad anxiety for awhile in 2020, but have no emotional or cognitive complaints. After a month and 11 follow up calls I finally got an appointment to begin the removal process at Mayo Clinic, where it was implanted. I am also having a sleep study done in November. I had a home one done and have mild apnea (6 incidents per hour) that shouldnÛªt be making me fatigued/hypersomniac. I need someone to review the big picture and let me know if I sound crazy.

It isn't uncommon to have some stimulation of the facial nerve with the device. An audiologist fixes that by changing the electrode stimulations such that it doesn't do that. If there are zaps or other concerning things, an audiologist can interrogate it to determine what is going on. You may be perceiving facial stimulation as zaps. Either way, this wouldn't have anything to do with what you are experiencing in the neck.

However, it is generally recommended to minimize your exposure to secondhand vapor as much as possible, especially in the days leading up to your surgery. This could involve limiting the time you spend in the same room as your spouse while they are using their e-cigarette, and increasing ventilation by opening windows or using an air purifier.\r\rIf you are concerned about the potential effects of secondhand vapor on your surgery, it may be helpful to discuss this with your healthcare provider.

It lists something I think says HIV but there is no follow-up paperwork regarding HIV anywhere else in the file. It could also say \"KIV\" but I can't find any information on what that would be. This a military medical file from the United States. The person in question has denied having any STIs at any point.If a patient had HIV/AIDS, would a medical file from the 1990s list only \"HIV\" with no context or further information given? It could also be that the portion of the file that covers HIV testing was removed on purpose.I found my ex partner's medical file while packing to move and am now worried that I have been exposed to HIV. Please and thank you for any help you can give.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Very unlikely for a record to mention HIV and then have no follow up studies or notes. The 90s were the gray ages for HIV but not the dark ages so I canÛªt see any medical file being scrubbed of this diagnosis.KIV - shorthand for potassium IV in orders but thatÛªs all I can think of If youÛªre worried, get tested. No one will deny you this test. Not worth guessing.\nmodel\n###Empathetic Response:",

There are many different types of HPV, and some can cause health problems, such as genital warts and certain types of cancer. Other types of HPV have no visible symptoms and may go away on their own.\r\rIt's understandable that you may have concerns about your partner's HPV infection, but it's important to remember that HPV is very common and most people who have it do not have any serious health problems as a result. While HPV can increase the risk of certain types of cancer, including cervical cancer, most people with HPV do not develop cancer.\r\rIf you are not already vaccinated against HPV, you may want to consider getting the HPV vaccine. The vaccine can help protect against the types of HPV that are most likely to cause cancer. It is most effective when given to people who have not yet been exposed to HPV, so it is generally recommended for people who are younger than 26 years old. Even if you have already been exposed to HPV, you may still benefit from vaccination, as the vaccine can protect against some types of HPV that you have not yet been exposed to.\r\rIt is up to your partner to decide whether or not to disclose their HPV infection to you or to future partners. However, it is important for both partners to be honest with each other about their sexual health and to discuss ways to reduce the risk of transmission. This can include using condoms and/or dental dams during sexual activity, and getting vaccinated against HPV.\r\rIn the end, the most important thing is to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your concerns and to make decisions together about how to protect each other's health.

It is available in both a topical form (applied to the skin) and an oral form. While it is generally safe to use, there are some potential side effects to be aware of.\r\rThe most common side effects of topical minoxidil are skin irritation, redness, and dryness. These side effects usually go away after a few weeks of use.\r\rIn rare cases, minoxidil can cause more serious side effects, including chest pain, rapid heartbeat, fainting, and swelling of the hands and feet. These side effects are more likely to occur with the oral form of the medication, but they can also occur with the topical form.\r\rIf you have a history of hypertension, anxiety, or OCD, you may be at an increased risk of experiencing these side effects.

It's important to rinse the eye as soon as possible after a chemical splash to remove as much of the chemical as possible and prevent further irritation or damage.

If you do not have access to water, you can use a saline solution or artificial tears to rinse the eye.\r\rIf you are experiencing significant pain, redness, or vision changes, or if you are unable to rinse your eye properly, you should seek medical attention immediately. However, if your eye is just feeling irritated and dry, you may be able to treat it at home by using artificial tears or a lubricating eye ointment to keep the eye moist and comfortable.\r\rIt is unlikely that you will go blind from getting bleach splashed in your eye, but it is important to take care of the eye and seek medical attention if necessary to prevent further irritation or damage.",

It can also cause a yellow or white coating on the tonsils and difficulty swallowing. Tonsillitis can be caused by bacteria or a virus.\r\rPeritonsillar abscess: This is a collection of pus that forms near the tonsil. It can cause swelling and pain in the tonsils, as well as difficulty swallowing.\r\rTonsil stones: These are small, hard masses that form in the tonsils and can cause symptoms like swelling, pain, and difficulty swallowing.\r\rIt's important to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you can try using a saltwater rinse to help reduce swelling and discomfort. To make a saltwater rinse, mix 1/4 teaspoon of salt into a cup of warm water. Swish the solution around in your mouth for 30 seconds, then spit it out.

This will help ensure your safety and the quality of the images produced.\r\rRegarding the safety of your eyes during an MRI, it is generally recommended that you keep your eyes closed during the procedure. This is because the strong magnetic field used during an MRI can potentially affect the muscles in the eye and cause discomfort or movement. Wearing an eye mask and keeping your eyes closed under the mask should be safe.\r\rIf you have anxiety about keeping your eyes closed during the MRI, it is important to communicate this to the MRI technologist and the radiologist.

        "ChatGPT Response": "It sounds like you have been experiencing a persistent and difficult-to-treat case of oral thrush. It is understandable that you are feeling distressed by this.\r\rOral thrush is a fungal infection caused by the yeast Candida. It typically appears as white, raised lesions on the tongue and inside of the cheeks. In some cases, it can cause difficulty swallowing, a loss of taste, or a burning sensation in the mouth.\r\rThere are a few potential reasons why your oral thrush has been difficult to treat. One possibility is that you have an underlying health condition that is making it harder for your body to fight off the infection. For example, people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV or cancer, may be more prone to developing persistent thrush. Additionally, certain medications, such as corticosteroids or antibiotics, can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the mouth and make it easier for Candida to grow.\r\rIt is also possible that you are dealing with a resistant strain of Candida. In this case, the usual treatment options may not be effective. In such cases, your healthcare provider may need to prescribe a different antifungal medication or use a combination of drugs to treat the infection.\r\rThere are a few things you can try to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. These include:\r\rRinsing your mouth with saltwater several times a day\rAvoiding sugary foods and drinks\rUsing a soft toothbrush and avoiding toothpaste with a strong flavor\rSucking on ice chips or popsicles to soothe a sore throat\rI recommend discussing your treatment options with your healthcare provider. They may be able to suggest additional steps you can take to manage your symptoms and get the infection under control. It may also be helpful to see a specialist, such as an infectious disease specialist, for further evaluation and treatment.",

I did a week long course of Diflucan first, followed by a week course of Fluconazole when that didnÛªt work. Since that also failed, they then gave me another week of Fluconazole, mixed with Nystatin swish &amp; swallow. That did not work. Since then, IÛªve done three rounds of Itraconazole (100mg, 2 pills) along with the Nystatin swish &amp; swallow. I still have oral thrush after these 10-ish treatments.

The Itraconazole has been the most effective, but as soon as itÛªs almost completely gone, it pops right back up. Itraconazole is the one IÛªm currently on.I do have gastro issues (I wake up dry-heaving sometimes, and regularly have diarrhea &amp; stomach pain) but I have a specialist appt coming up to get myself checked out. IÛªm chronically ill with Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos, but thatÛªs my only DXÛªed illness at this point. IÛªve done two HIV tests which came up negative, hepatitis tests, and a HOST of other bloodwork including a CBC. My WBC count was elevated for a couple of months along with a swollen lymph node by my collarbone, but my WBC count is back to normal &amp; the node is no longer swollen. Other than that, my only abnormal numbers are my Chloride (just a smidge low) and my Alkaline Phosphate (also a smidge low!)My dr recÛªd an oral swab to see what kind of Candida it was, however her own office, both Labcorp locations by me, and the hospital near me donÛªt do that swab.

ItÛªs almost a miracle - on days with no sumatriptan sheÛªs bed-bound, but on days where she takes it, she can almost live a life again.

It's always best to discuss your specific case with a qualified healthcare provider who has access to all of your medical information and can provide personalized advice.\r\rBased on the information in the report, it looks like you had an MRI of your neck. The MRI showed a few findings that might be contributing to your neck pain.\r\rOne finding is degenerative changes in the cervical spine, which means that the bones in your neck (the vertebrae) have started to wear down or break down due to age or other factors. This can lead to pain and other symptoms.\r\rAnother finding is disc degeneration, which means that the cushions between the vertebrae (the discs) have also started to break down and wear out. This can cause pain and other symptoms as well.\r\rThe report also mentions some mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck (called spinal stenosis), as well as some mild bulging of the discs (called disc bulges). These findings can also contribute to neck pain and other symptoms.\r\rIt's important to keep in mind that MRI findings like these are common as we age, and they may not necessarily be the cause of your neck pain.

Cuticle infections can be caused by bacteria or fungi, and they can sometimes spread to the nail or the surrounding skin if left untreated. Your doctor can determine the cause of the infection and prescribe appropriate treatment, which may include antibiotics or antifungal medications. In the meantime, you can try to keep the affected area clean and dry and apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment or cream to help prevent the infection from spreading. Avoid picking at or biting your nails, and keep your hands and nails clean and trimmed to help prevent future infections.",

Aortic coarctation is a narrowing of the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. It can cause high blood pressure, cold feet, and numbness in the legs. However, these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions. It is important to have a thorough evaluation by a cardiologist to determine the cause of your symptoms and to determine the best course of treatment.\r\rIf you are diagnosed with aortic coarctation, the next steps will depend on the severity of the condition and your overall health.

I am freaking out as I finally looked into it (It sounded minor, as it just sounded like less blood possible went to my legs) and it states the average life expectancy for someone that didn't get it treated as an infant is 35 years old. I'm 28. I'm actually freaking out. My question is, does this seem unlikely? I was consistently checked up on until I was 18. My blood pressure wasn't \"High for my age\" until around 18 (Despite how I was never put on meds for it until now).I feel like maybe I'm being over paranoid, but I match too many of these symptoms. Pale legs, easily cold feet, as a side note laying down in certain ways makes the top of one of my legs go numb now. I suppose a second question: if this turns out to be what it is, are my next steps very optimistic? I see papers claiming life expectancy and life long challenges for infants that get surgery for this, what about a 28 year old? Thanks for any help.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Hi OP. I'm sorry you're going through this, must be difficult.&amp;#x200B;Could it be coarctation of the aorta? Maybe. I can't know without examining you thoroughly and without an ankle brachial index (BP comparison between ankle and bicep.) You would also need an echocardiogram to confirm it.&amp;#x200B;Let me answer the other question about the life expectancy. There is something you need to understand about life expectancy: It is a statistical figure.YOU are not a statistic. You are a real person with a real body that may or may not be similar to others. Not only that, but also the statistic you are pulling is for those who NEVER get treated. I don't like to tell patients their chances of survival or death based on averages. I prefer to tailor the discussion to the patient. From what you've said so far, it seems you have been mostly asymptomatic. The cause of morbidity and death for patients with this disease is development of hypertension, kidney disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic dissection, and heart failure. From what you've said so far, I can say you most likely have not developed any of those complications, however some lab tests and imaging need to be done to check for sure. Your condition can still be salvaged and your life expectancy prolonged. Yes I believe you do have \"optimistic\" chances.IF it is coarctation of the aorta, you will need more lab tests and imaging and you will be managed accordingly. I assure you though, you will not drop dead suddenly just because you have coarctation of the aorta, it usually leads to complications which you will definitely notice. Try not to think too much about it, once you have confirmation of diagnosis, then work up can start and management can proceed.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n###Empathetic Response:",

For context, here is the question related to the medical response:\n\n\n###Question: 28/M/5'10/CaucasionHey all, wouldn't normally post here but having a freak out.After years of neglect, got onto my blood pressure, but cardiologist is checking for a possible undiagnosed aortic coarctation. I am freaking out as I finally looked into it (It sounded minor, as it just sounded like less blood possible went to my legs) and it states the average life expectancy for someone that didn't get it treated as an infant is 35 years old. I'm 28. I'm actually freaking out. My question is, does this seem unlikely? I was consistently checked up on until I was 18. My blood pressure wasn't \"High for my age\" until around 18 (Despite how I was never put on meds for it until now).I feel like maybe I'm being over paranoid, but I match too many of these symptoms. Pale legs, easily cold feet, as a side note laying down in certain ways makes the top of one of my legs go numb now. I suppose a second question: if this turns out to be what it is, are my next steps very optimistic? I see papers claiming life expectancy and life long challenges for infants that get surgery for this, what about a 28 year old? Thanks for any help.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Hi OP. I'm sorry you're going through this, must be difficult.&amp;#x200B;Could it be coarctation of the aorta? Maybe. I can't know without examining you thoroughly and without an ankle brachial index (BP comparison between ankle and bicep.) You would also need an echocardiogram to confirm it.&amp;#x200B;Let me answer the other question about the life expectancy. There is something you need to understand about life expectancy: It is a statistical figure.YOU are not a statistic. You are a real person with a real body that may or may not be similar to others. Not only that, but also the statistic you are pulling is for those who NEVER get treated. I don't like to tell patients their chances of survival or death based on averages. I prefer to tailor the discussion to the patient. From what you've said so far, it seems you have been mostly asymptomatic. The cause of morbidity and death for patients with this disease is development of hypertension, kidney disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic dissection, and heart failure. From what you've said so far, I can say you most likely have not developed any of those complications, however some lab tests and imaging need to be done to check for sure. Your condition can still be salvaged and your life expectancy prolonged. Yes I believe you do have \"optimistic\" chances.IF it is coarctation of the aorta, you will need more lab tests and imaging and you will be managed accordingly. I assure you though, you will not drop dead suddenly just because you have coarctation of the aorta, it usually leads to complications which you will definitely notice. Try not to think too much about it, once you have confirmation of diagnosis, then work up can start and management can proceed.\nmodel\n###Empathetic Response:",

While it can be effective in treating a wide range of conditions, long-term use of prednisone can have a number of potential side effects and risks. Some of the concerns with long-term prednisone use include:\r\rOsteoporosis: Long-term use of prednisone can lead to decreased bone density, which can increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. It is important to speak with your doctor about ways to protect your bones, such as getting enough calcium and vitamin D, and possibly taking medications to help prevent osteoporosis.\r\rWeight gain: Prednisone can cause weight gain, especially in the face, back, and abdomen. This can be due to an increase in appetite, as well as fluid retention.\r\rMood changes: Prednisone can cause mood changes, such as increased irritability and anxiety.\r\rHigh blood pressure: Prednisone can raise blood pressure, which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.\r\rWeakened immune system: Long-term use of prednisone can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections.\r\rIt is important to discuss the potential risks and benefits of long-term prednisone use with your doctor, and to closely monitor for any side effects. Your doctor will be able to recommend the best treatment plan for you based on your specific situation.",

It can be very frustrating and concerning to have changes in your senses, and it's understandable that you are worried about the cause.\r\rThere are several potential causes for a loss of sense of smell, and it's possible that more than one factor may be contributing in your case. Some common causes include:\r\rInfections, such as sinusitis or a viral illness\rAllergies\rMedications, including some over-the-counter and prescription drugs\rNasal polyps (small, non-cancerous growths in the nasal passages)\rTrauma to the head or nose\rChronic nasal congestion\rHormonal changes, such as those that occur during menopause\rIt's also possible that your loss of sense of smell could be related to tobacco use, as the first doctor suggested. However, it's important to consider all potential causes and to get a thorough evaluation from a medical professional.\r\rIt sounds like you have already seen several doctors, but it might be helpful to consider seeking a second opinion from an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) or a neurologist. They will be able to assess your medical history and perform any necessary tests to determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend the appropriate treatment.\r\rIn the meantime, it's important to try to manage any underlying conditions, such as allergies or sinusitis, and to avoid any known triggers for your symptoms. It's also important to practice good hygiene, including washing your hands frequently, to help prevent the spread of infections.\r\rI hope this information is helpful.

First, all smells seemed to be the same, like everything I smelled seems like beans or cigarrettes. A few months later I wasn't be capable of smell anything. the problem: COVID 19 started and no one was concerned about going to a doctor for \"little diseases\". First I thought that was a sinusitis crisis so I waited a while for the whole COVID thing passes and then I  go to a doctor. The first one told me that probably the cause was the tobacco use. He prescribed me prednisolone and an CAT scan from the perinasal sinuses. The prednisolone don't resolve at all my problems and I waited a long time for the next appointment because the doctor has left the hospital and they put me on a waiting list. Meanwhile I payed for a private specialist who prescribed me more prednisolone and didn't do or say anything important to help me. The third and last doctor told me that probably was a virus that anyone could catch in a simple flu, and said that probably I would never get my smell sense back ever again because it's been a long time and my nerve is already so damaged that it doesn't recover anymore.Right now, I'm waiting a call from a septum deviation surgery (that will help me to breath better but no recovering my smell senses) and I'm a little bit lost here.I'm thinking that the cause could be the sinusitis, the tobacco, a random virus, some medication that have an side effect... or could be anything worse??? like an indicative of degenerative desease? Idk. I feel like the doctors don't discarted other causes and I'm just waiting to see what happens. Nothing, because I won't get able to smell anything in my life.

Many of these are benign (non-cancerous) and are caused by a variety of factors, such as irritation or infection. However, it is important to have any new or unusual lump or bump on the penis evaluated by a healthcare provider to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.\r\rIn this case, given the location and description of the lump and the fact that it does not move, it is possible that it could be a benign cyst or abscess. It is also possible that it could be a lymph node that has become enlarged due to an infection or other condition. It is not possible to accurately diagnose the cause of the lump without a physical examination and potentially additional testing.\r\rGiven the concern about the possibility of penile cancer, it is important to have the lump evaluated as soon as possible. If you are unable to see a healthcare provider until Monday, it is reasonable to visit a walk-in clinic or an emergency department if you are experiencing pain or discomfort, or if the lump is rapidly growing or changing in any way. If you are not experiencing any symptoms and the lump has not changed in size or appearance, it may be reasonable to wait until you are able to see a healthcare provider on Monday.\r\rIt is important to remember that the vast majority of lumps or bumps on the penis are benign and are not cancerous.

In addition, allergies can cause inflammation in the nasal passages and throat, which can also contribute to a sore throat.\r\rTo help alleviate your symptoms, you can try the following measures:\r\rAvoid exposure to the dog as much as possible. If you have to be around the dog, try to keep your distance and limit your time with it.\r\rUse over-the-counter allergy medicine. Antihistamines can help reduce sneezing, a runny nose, and other allergy symptoms.\r\rDrink plenty of fluids. Staying hydrated can help soothe your throat and flush out any irritants.\r\rUse a humidifier. Dry air can irritate your throat and nasal passages, so using a humidifier can help add moisture to the air and reduce irritation.\r\rTry throat lozenges or warm liquids.

The laboratory values that are most consistent with iron deficiency anemia are a low hemoglobin level, a low hematocrit level, a low MCV (mean corpuscular volume, which is a measure of the size of red blood cells), and a high RDW (red cell distribution width, which is a measure of the variability in size of red blood cells).\r\rIt is also possible that you may have other underlying conditions that are contributing to your anemia, such as a chronic illness, a bleeding disorder, or a vitamin deficiency. It is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the cause of your anemia and to determine the appropriate treatment.\r\rAs for the results of your urinalysis, it appears that you have a trace amount of ketones, protein, leukocyte esterase, and bacteria in your urine. These findings may be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or other underlying medical condition. It is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the cause of these abnormalities and to determine the appropriate treatment.",

It's completely normal to feel anxious when you are sick, especially if you have a history of hypochondria. However, it's important to try to stay calm and not let your fears get the best of you.\r\rIt's possible that the antibiotic you were prescribed may not have been effective at treating your tonsillitis. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as if the bacteria causing the infection are resistant to the antibiotic or if you did not take the medication as directed. If your tonsillitis was caused by a virus, such as COVID-19, antibiotics will not be effective as they only work against bacterial infections.\r\rIt's also possible that you may have a persistent or recurrent tonsillitis, which means that the infection has not fully resolved and continues to come back. This can be caused by a number of factors, including a weakened immune system or underlying health conditions.\r\rIt's important to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations and complete the full course of treatment as prescribed. If you are still experiencing symptoms after finishing your course of treatment, it's important to follow up with your healthcare provider to determine the cause and determine the appropriate next steps.\r\rIt's understandable that you are feeling anxious and depressed, but it's important to remember that you are not alone and that there are effective treatments available for tonsillitis.

I never had a fever while this was happening, I was mildly constipated a few times but was able to use bathroom normally a few times and pass gas. But it felt gurgly in the lower right area as well. I'm scared I might have been misdiagnosed with a UTI, because I heard that can happen. I have really bad anxiety and I'm afraid,\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Doubt it's appendicitis with a negative CT after 3 days of symptoms\nmodel\n###Empathetic Response:",

They're all fully vaccinated and always up-to-date on regular check-ups. My 6-year-old, who I'll call J, is the only kiddo with any issues, and they've generally been mild. He has moderate asthma which is controlled with Flovent, but has otherwise been a healthy and active kid. But recently, J has been getting sick a LOT. I just picked up his third prescription for antibiotics in 30 days, and he has had a fever for 6 days now that doesn't completely go away even with multiple fever reducers (it does go down enough that he's comfortable though). Yesterday I noticed he has swollen, bleeding gums and a few ulcer-like sores in the back of his throat which the doctor diagnosed as hand, foot, and mouth disease (no tests were done though). Today I brought him back in due to his fever spiking to 104.6 and him struggling to walk/move last night (also improved - but not completely fixed - with meds) and they did a strep test which came back positive.The reason I'm really worried though is the weight loss and his medical record in general. I looked up his growth chart when I got home (I can access his records online) and he has grown 1.3 inches in the last 6 months but his weight dropped by 1 pound, causing his BMI to go from the 20th percentile to the 1st. I also looked at his blood work. They checked his hemoglobin at his 6-year checkup in July and that was low at 10, but they told me to just make sure he's eating iron (he eats a lot of iron-rich foods but doc said to just increase them). The last time he had a CBC was 5 years ago at his 1 year check-up but I looked at it anyway and his lymphocytes were high and neutrophils were low, but I don't think his doctor ever said anything about abnormal results so maybe that's not a concern? I didn't have online access at the time so I'm sure when they didn't call with results, I assumed they were normal.Should I have the doctor do a CBC if he keeps getting infections or not gaining weight/losing weight? Or should the doctor tell me if these things are concerning? I feel like a hypochondriac but I really just have a feeling something isn't right. :(\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Not likely to be something to stress over.Though it varies by your community/exposure risks, I have seen multiple cases between the hospital and clinic this last month with multiple viruses, back to back viruses, etc. It is not unreasonable that he was sick multiple times.The fever is likely from whatever viral processes he had going on.  Outside of strep nothing sounds bacterial from what youÛªve mentioned so I think 3 rounds of antibiotics was more appeasement or risk stratification than ÛÏappropriateÛ treatment.  Without a known or suspected bacterial nidus, no reason for antibiotics.He could have poorer dental hygiene with being sick, inflammation from infection, or it could be something like a vitamin C deficiency with the bleeding gums and recurrent infections.  Load him up with some emergenC.Weight loss is normal when being sick and I wouldnÛªt even look at his weight again until heÛªs been healthy for around 4-6 weeks with normal appetite.HFM is a clinical diagnosis, I wouldnÛªt send you to get the $800+ PCR test to confirm it in just about any case, since the management wouldnÛªt change.His CBC 5 years ago is has virtually no relevance to his current state unless there was a pathological anomaly like leukemia found on the initial one.  I wouldnÛªt even concern myself with mild anemia in 1-2 year olds at that level due to increased milk consumption and the body still ramping up production while growing rapidly.At the end of the day nothing here is concerning for him being sick beyond seasonal illness but you should speak to your pediatrician about it in more detail so you feel comfortable that youÛªve covered your bases if youÛªre truly still worried.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n###Empathetic Response:",

Meds: omeprazole daily, famotidine prn, cetirizine daily. I had an abdominal/pelvic CT today for months long issue of epigastric pain radiating to the back. Endoscopy was normal, symptoms not relieved by PPIs or H2 blockers, hence the CT.My question is regarding an incidental finding on the CT that the GI office did not bring up when they called me to discuss results. I only saw the complete report after getting off the phone.There was nothing on the CT that could explain my GI symptoms, but under the \"Findings\" section for lower chest \"mild scarring/atelectasis\" is listed. No other description is given. However, these findings are left out of the \"Impressions\" section of the report. As I said, I'm a former smoker. I have also had pneumonia at least 3 times in my life with a bout back in April. I didn't have a chest x-ray until May, a couple of weeks later, and that read \"Impression: Peribronchial thickening consistent with bronchiolitis and/or reactive airway disease\". No one called me to discuss those particular results and I had mostly recovered from the pneumonia (I thought) so I just shrugged it off. Turns out that since that bout of pneumonia, I have a harder time catching my breath than I used to and it's even a bit painful sometimes depending on the level of strain.The CT report is verbatim as follows:  \"Lower chest: mild scarring/atelectasis\" Can someone explain to me what this actually might mean for me clinically? Google U just screams \"COLLAPSED LUNG\" at me and that is not helpful. Is this something I need to be concerned about? What could be the cause? Can it be related to the findings on that x-ray? Should I get a pulmonology consult?I should add that I am changing insurance plans for the 2nd time in one year and the town I live in has a provider shortage and most of them are only accepting new OB patients. It has been difficult getting care because of this.Thanks for the input.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Atelectasis isnÛªt an uncommon finding. It just means your lung in that area is not being inflated. It is indeed collapsed. This can be for any number of reason but for most it is due to lack of exercise or activity. ItÛªs also common in those with recurrent infections or get bronchitis because gunk builds up and blocks airways from getting proper aeration. Typically when you work your body, you tend to breath in harder which opens up all portions of your lungs. Your lungs are made up of tons of tiny little balloons (alveoli). The balloons at the bottom of your lung sometimes need extra force to really open them up. In your case, if you have scarring in that area, it may be even harder to inflate. Atelectasis is when the balloons collapse and havenÛªt been opened up in some time. It looks like your lung tissue has shrunken but typically isnÛªt a problem unless a large portion of your lung is affected. If youÛªve never tried one, a spirometer might be beneficial to help open up this portion of your lung. Guaifenesin to clear out mucus may also help. It can also be painful to open that portion of the lung up if atelectasis has been long standing.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n###Empathetic Response:",

You've described a muscle near your ear that you can control, and the accompanying rushing/ringing sound you hear is understandably unsettling.\n\nThere are a few potential explanations for what you're experiencing. One possibility is stapedial myoclonus, which affects the stapedius muscle, a key player in hearing. If the stapedius muscle spasms involuntarily, it can cause a ringing or buzzing sound in the ears.\n\nAnother possibility is tensor tympani syndrome, which affects the tensor tympani muscle, also involved in hearing. If the tensor tympani muscle spasms, it can lead to a similar ringing or buzzing sound.\n\nIt's important to note that these conditions typically don't require medical intervention if they're not causing significant discomfort. However, if you're experiencing persistent or bothersome symptoms, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and guidance.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some natural remedies that may help alleviate the symptoms of stapedial myoclonus or tensor tympani syndrome, such as relaxation techniques, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and using ear drops or wax softeners.\n\nI understand that experiencing unusual",

The presence of blood in your phlegm and nosebleeds could be a result of irritation or inflammation in your respiratory system caused by the infection. It's also possible that the bleeding and ear pain could be unrelated to your respiratory symptoms.\r\rIf you are concerned about your symptoms, it's important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment. They will be able to assess your symptoms and determine the cause of your bleeding and other symptoms. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. If you have a fever, over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) can help to reduce it. Avoid smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, as this can irritate your respiratory system and make your symptoms worse.",

It's important to remember that every person is different, and the effects of an overdose can vary depending on many factors, including the specific substances involved, the person's age, weight, and overall health, and the amount of each substance that was consumed.\r\rIn general, an overdose of oxycodone, tramadol, and benadryl can cause respiratory depression, which means that the person's breathing may slow down or stop altogether. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Alcohol and hydroxyzine can also cause respiratory depression and may increase the risk of an overdose.\r\rIf your friend was found nonresponsive and taken to the emergency room, it's likely that they are receiving medical treatment to help them recover. This may include medications to reverse the effects of the overdose and support their breathing, as well as supportive care to help them stabilize. It's not uncommon for people who have overdosed to be placed on a ventilator (breathing machine) for a period of time.\r\rIt's important to remember that the prognosis for someone who has overdosed can be difficult to predict, as it depends on many factors. It's important to stay in touch with your friend's medical team and follow their recommendations for treatment and care.

It can be frustrating and difficult to figure out the cause of pain when there isn't a clear diagnosis.\r\rBased on the symptoms you've described, it's possible that you could be experiencing radial tunnel syndrome, which is a condition that occurs when the radial nerve becomes compressed as it passes through the wrist. This can cause pain and other symptoms in the wrist and hand.\r\rIt's also possible that the pain could be due to another condition, such as De Quervain's tenosynovitis or a ligament injury.\r\rIf the MRI and ultrasound scans did not reveal any abnormalities, it may be helpful to see a specialist, such as a hand therapist or a hand and wrist surgeon, who can evaluate your wrist and determine the cause of your pain. They may also be able to suggest treatment options that could help to reduce your symptoms.\r\rIn the meantime, it may be helpful to rest your wrist as much as possible and avoid activities that make the pain worse. Using a wrist splint or wrap can also help to support the wrist and reduce strain on the muscles and tendons.\r\rI hope this information is helpful, and I hope you are able to find relief from your wrist pain soon.",

Indeed, I have had pain in my wrist for almost a year now. The pain appeared after a game of bowling (I don't remember exactly how I got hurt because at the time I didn't feel any pain). At first I thought it was tendonitis, so I rested my wrist, but nothing helped: the pain persisted.The pain is on the radial side of the wrist. To be precise, I would say that the pain is located in the synovial sheath at the level of the radial extensors. The pain is quite diffuse (from the extensor pollicis longus to the abductor pollicis longus), so it is complicated to determine a precise location of the pain.The pain is always present to an acceptable degree but it intensifies when I pronate or flex my wrist, for example. Tennis is typically the kind of sport I can't do anymore because the pain is too intense.A few months ago I had an MRI scan but the radiologists didn't see anything abnormal. I think they must have looked wrong because when I did an ultrasound scan a few weeks later, they told me I had inflammation of the sheath and that an infiltration would solve the problem. The problem is that the cortisone infiltration (done on the radial extensors) that I did, didn't work. So now, I don't know who to believe and I don't know the cause of my pain. I think that maybe the problem is related to the nerves (radial or medial) and not to the tendons  but that's just a guess.Is there anyone here who could look at my MRI (I'll send you a video) because I'm sure they didn't look properly...&amp;#x200B;Cheers !\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Sure sounds like tendonitis. Nerve pain in that area would generally not be exacerbated by moving the wrist, though pain with pronation could potentially point to nerve entrapment at the elbow. Any history of elbow injuries? The negative MRI is good news that there wasn't anything lurking at the wrist like a missed broken bone.
