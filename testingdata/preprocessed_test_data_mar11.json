        "ChatGPT Response": "I'm sorry to hear about your friend's mom. It can be very difficult to navigate the healthcare system, especially when dealing with a serious medical condition like cirrhosis of the liver. Here are a few options to consider that may be able to help your friend's mom get the treatment she needs:\rTransplant centers: Many transplant centers have financial assistance programs that can help cover the cost of a transplant for uninsured or underinsured patients. These programs may be able to help your friend's mom get the transplant she needs, even if she does not have insurance.\rMedicare: If your friend's mom is over the age of 65, she may be eligible for Medicare, which is a federal health insurance program for seniors. Medicare can help cover the cost of a liver transplant, as well as other medical expenses.\rMedicaid: If your friend's mom has a low income, she may be eligible for Medicaid, which is a government-run health insurance program for low-income individuals and families. Medicaid can help cover the cost of a liver transplant, as well as other medical expenses.\rCharity care: Many hospitals and medical centers have charity care programs that provide free or discounted medical care to patients who are unable to pay. Your friend's mom may be able to get financial assistance through a charity care program.\rFundraising: Another option to consider is starting a fundraising campaign to help cover the cost of the transplant. There are a number of online platforms that make it easy to create and share a fundraising campaign. You could also reach out to local organizations or businesses to see if they would be willing to donate or help spread the word about your campaign.\rIt's important to keep in mind that getting a liver transplant is a complex process, and it may take some time to find a suitable donor and arrange for the transplant. Your friend's mom should work closely with her healthcare team to identify the best options for her situation.",

It's common for people to have difficulty adjusting to a new sleep schedule, especially when it involves waking up significantly earlier than they are used to. Here are a few strategies you can try to help shift your body's internal clock and improve your sleep:\r\rGradually adjust your bedtime: Instead of trying to go to sleep at a specific time, try gradually shifting your bedtime earlier by 15-30 minutes each night until you reach your desired bedtime. This can help your body slowly adjust to the new schedule.\r\rKeep a consistent sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help your body get into a regular rhythm.\r\rCreate a bedtime routine: Establish a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath or reading a book, to help you wind down before sleep.\r\rAvoid screens before bedtime: The blue light emitted by screens can disrupt your body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin, so try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.\r\rGet some sunlight during the day: Exposure to sunlight during the day can help regulate your body's internal clock.

I attached the notes of her discharge.\r\rThe patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.\r\rRheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read as\rwithin normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Internal medicine doc here but in my differential is Adult Onset Stills Disease which can still present in children and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The salmon colored rash lasting a few minutes is textbook for Adult Onset Stills Disease. \r\rI'm assuming she had blood cultures done at one or multiple points during her admission.

I was diagnosed with (diabetic) neuropathy  around 15 years of age. The symptoms were managable. I had tingling and burning sensation in my extremities, pain, reduced ability to feel temperature changes... Etc. I didn't much pay attention to it, untill two years ago. It started literally as a painful spot in my upper arm. Below the sholder, above the elbove. The apot wasnt bigger than the size of a avarage coin. It would hurt for few seconds, once in a day, which was weird for me, because it was localised, unlick neuropathy, where i couldnt locate just one painful spot.\rIt started from a spot and today i cant lift my arm anymore. The pain has spread throught my arm and should. My whole arm hurts, even my fingers. I cant lift arm, up or on the side, i can't put it behind my back anymore. I can barely wipe my glutes, etc, i have developed insomnia, because i cant sleep from the pain. The pain is not always there, but it mostly is. When i am not moving much, it hurts but not that bad. When i try to, for example take off my hoodie, which involes mu right arm to lift, the pain shoots, like someone stabed me. Why am I writing is to ask, if it is possible that this kind of pain is the result of neuropathy. I can use my arm normaly, if i am not raising it, or movimg it. Like if its to my body, i cam write normally, use my phone, tye my shoes, cook etc, but i have to lift it, than the pain is unmanageable and o immediately have to put back, beside my torso.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Hi!\r\rAnswer to your question, yes, those symptoms can be caused by diabetic peripheral neuropathy, you need your blood glucose controlled better, you can take pregabalin to control the pain that\u0089\u00db\u00aas due to diabetes..\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

It's understandable that you may feel anxious about going to the dentist, but seeking dental care is important for maintaining good oral health and overall well-being.\rIn Australia, there are a few options available for low-cost or no-cost dental care, depending on your circumstances. Here are some suggestions:\r1.\tMedicare: If you have a Medicare card, you may be eligible for the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) General Dental Scheme, which covers some dental services for children and adults with a disability, medical condition, or certain other circumstances. You can check your eligibility and find out more about the MBS General Dental Scheme by visiting the Medicare website or speaking with a Medicare representative.\r2.\tPublic dental clinics: Many states and territories in Australia operate public dental clinics that provide low-cost or no-cost dental care to eligible individuals, such as those with low incomes, children, and seniors. You can contact your local public dental clinic to find out if you are eligible and to make an appointment.\r3.\tPrivate dental care with payment plans: If you are not eligible for the MBS General Dental Scheme or public dental clinics, you may be able to seek dental care at a private practice. Some private practices offer payment plans or financing options to help make treatment more affordable. You can ask about these options when you make an appointment.\rWhen you go to the dentist, you will generally be asked to fill out a medical history form and then be seen by the dentist for an examination. The dentist will assess your oral health and discuss any treatment recommendations with you. You can ask about the cost of treatment and payment options before proceeding with any treatment.

        "ChatGPT Response": "It appears that the PET scan has shown some changes in certain lymph nodes in your body. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures found throughout your body that help to filter out harmful substances and fight infection. In the context of cancer, lymph nodes can sometimes become involved in the spread of cancer cells from the original tumor site to other parts of the body.\rThe first finding mentioned in the results is a calcified left hilar lymph node that is unchanged in size from a previous exam. This means that there is a small, hard mass of tissue in the left hilar region (an area near the center of your chest) that has not changed in size since it was last seen. The calcification suggests that the tissue has undergone some sort of hardening process. The fact that this lymph node was not previously hypermetabolic (meaning it did not show high levels of metabolic activity on a previous scan) but now has a maximum SUV (standardized uptake value, which is a measure of how much radioactivity is taken up by the tissue) of 5.3 suggests that there may be something going on with this lymph node that was not present before, and that further evaluation is needed to determine whether this is a metastasis (spread) of cancer cells.\rThe second finding mentioned in the results is an improvement in the size, extent, and hypermetabolic activity of retroperitoneal adenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum, which is the area behind the abdominal cavity). This is generally considered a positive finding, as it suggests that the chemotherapy you received may have been effective in reducing the size and activity of these lymph nodes.\rThe third finding mentioned in the results is the absence of any other suspected areas of metastatic disease. This means that, aside from the left hilar lymph node mentioned above, there are no other areas in your body that appear to be involved with the spread of cancer cells.\rIt's important to note that PET scans can be highly sensitive tests, and can sometimes pick up small changes that may not necessarily be clinically significant. It's also important to keep in mind that the results of a single scan should not be taken in isolation, but rather should be considered in the context of all of your medical history and the results of other tests and exams. It's best to discuss the results of your PET scan with your oncologist, who will be able to provide more information and context based on your specific case.

Bad at Reddit format. \r\r\rDiagnosed with stage 3 seminoma in July of this year. Had surgery and did four rounds of etoposide and cisplatin as chemotherapy. Seminoma did not present physically, only presentation was severe back pain. I have had other back issues so I lived in pain for close to a year. Went to oncologist per ER referral and Ultrasound confirmed seminoma. \r\r\rI got a pet scan today after completing chemo last week. I was very optimistic and my doctor has given me no reason to suspect there would be any problems. He said 95% sure chemo would take care of it. I am going to paste the results that were posted on my patient portal below. I am a big boy and a logical thinker please Don\u0089\u00db\u00aat sugar coat theses results, translate and explain if possible. I was expecting good news but I can tell this is not. I can have peace if I understand it. My follow up with my oncologist is not until next week and I\u0089\u00db\u00aam very anxious and want to understand. \r\rBegin Results:\u0089\u00db\u00d3\u0089\u00db\u00d3\u0089\u00db\u00d3\u0089\u00db\u00d3-:\r\rImpression:\r1.Hypermetabolic left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam. Calcification present. Metastatic disease cannot be excluded as this node was not hypermetabolic on prior exam. 2. Much improvement in retroperitoneal adenopathy in both size of lymph nodes, extent of lymph nodes, and decrease in hypermetabolic activity compared to prior exam. 3. No other areas of metastatic disease suspected.\r\r\r\rFindings:\r1. There is a calcified left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam probably about 1 cm in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV today of 5.3 and previously not hypermetabolic maximum activity 2.0.\r\r\r\r2.  The previously noted large intra-aortocaval lymph node has markedly decreased in size and on today's exam is subcentimeter in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV of 6.8 whereas previously maximum SUV was 16.6.\r\r\r\r3.  More inferiorly in the intra-aortocaval region of the retroperitoneum where multiple previous adjacent hypermetabolic lymph nodes were seen with a maximum SUV of 20.8, on today's exam 1 lymph node measuring roughly 8 mm in short axis measurement is present maximum SUV 6.8.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: A PET scan obtained right after finishing chemotherapy increases the likelihood of false positive results. It takes time for your body to clean up after chemotherapy or surgery or radiation. The residual activity that a PET scan captures in the active areas can take a few months to calm down. The presence of hypermetabolic areas is not unexpected when it was only a week since your last treatment. \r\rThe fact that the areas of activity noted on prior scans are now smaller is good news. It strongly suggests that your cancer is responding to treatment. The new spot in your chest (the hilar node) may or may not be significant. There are other things that can cause a node to light up on PET scan. The presence of calcifications in a node is usually an indication of benign causes, rather than malignant causes of hypermetabolic activity. The only way to know for sure is a biopsy, which they probably won't recommend right now. \r\rNote: I am not an oncologist. Talk to your doctor about the results and the plan for follow-up. \rGood luck!\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

Info: 25M, 5'9\", 180 pounds, no meds, no smoking, no previous medical issues.\r\rI've been having intermittent testicular area pain for the past 3 days. It's a quick sharp pain that's mostly happening on the left testicle area. Pain scale 6/10. Pain comes around every 2 minutes. The pain sometimes shoots up to the left kidney area.\r\rI made a really stupid decision yesterday by going to the ER with no insurance. They gave me an ultrasound, physical exam, and urine test. They apparently found no signs of torsion, epididymitis, variocele, cancer, and kidney stones. No swelling found on the ultrasound. The ER rushed me out at around 4am.\r\rIs it maybe a hernia or some sort of partial intermittent torsion?\r\rI'm so fking scared. I don't know what to do. I got so much to do but I can't focus and concentrate on anything. I know the ER bill is going to be massive without insurance. Today I just signed up an application for Medicaid and VA healthcare finally. I need this pain to go. Please help. It would mean the world.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: It could be a hernia, although hernia symptoms usually are not every 2 minutes on the dot, but rather worsened by movement, activity, etc. If they did an US of your scrotum and not the inguinal region, then this would not have been seen on the US in the ER. You should see your PCP\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

For context, here is the question related to the medical response:\n\n###Question: First T/C seizure, then first migraine less than 3 weeks later? So, on September 17 I (21F) had an unprovoked, tonic clonic seizure. The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which I\u0089\u00db\u00aave never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and i was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasn\u0089\u00db\u00aat fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadn\u0089\u00db\u00aat opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I know its not. I\u0089\u00db\u00aave fainted a handful of times in my life and it\u0089\u00db\u00aas never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didn\u0089\u00db\u00aat know i was supposed to go to the ER, because I didn\u0089\u00db\u00aat realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just won\u0089\u00db\u00aat believe me and said i just fainted. So i feel discouraged.\rYesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.\rMy parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and it\u0089\u00db\u00aas making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I don\u0089\u00db\u00aat want to find out it\u0089\u00db\u00aas too late if I don\u0089\u00db\u00aat do anything, but my family has always treated me as if i\u0089\u00db\u00aam faking illnesses, even though i never have and have never been dramatic in any way. please help. i\u0089\u00db\u00aam still on their insurance, so that\u0089\u00db\u00aas why it\u0089\u00db\u00aas important.\r\rthank you.\r\rTLDR: F21 has unprovoked, first TC seizure 09/17. First vestibular migraine 10/06 into 10/07. Any relation or cause for concern? Parents won\u0089\u00db\u00aat take me seriously. Please and thank you.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Based on the information provided I'm not sure this was actually a seizure and I wonder if this was a vaso vagal syncopal event. It's not uncommon for there to be a short duration of convulsive movements during syncope.\r\rThat being said, given the new headache it's reasonable to pursue brain imaging.\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

Took Paracetamol and Ibuprofen during the cold, now on nothing.\r\rThese blisters form sporadically on my right hand and are tingling/itchy to the touch. No pain or anything. I have no idea where they could be coming from. I\u0089\u00db\u00aave noticed a couple of itchy spots on my body the last two weeks which I though would be from mosquitoes but I don\u0089\u00db\u00aat think that\u0089\u00db\u00aas it. Most spots are just itching with no visible bite marks or blisters of any kind, but I don\u0089\u00db\u00aat have 2 or 3 tiny little blister on other parts of my body. Not really painful though, just kinda annoying and very small. The spot on my right hand has me worried though, I don\u0089\u00db\u00aat want it to break out even more.

It can be difficult to convince someone to stop believing in something that they have come to hold as truth, especially when it comes to matters of health.\rIt's understandable that you want to help your mom and do what you can to support her, but it's important to remember that you cannot force her to do anything. However, there are some things you can try to help her understand the dangers of the substances she is considering using:\r1.\tEncourage her to speak with her medical team: It's important that she has the opportunity to ask her doctors and other medical professionals any questions or concerns she may have about her treatment plan. They can provide reliable information and address any myths or misinformation she may have come across.\r2.\tOffer to help her find reputable sources of information: There is a lot of false or misleading information available online, and it can be overwhelming to try to sort through it all. Offer to help your mom find reliable sources of information, such as reputable cancer organizations or peer-reviewed medical journals.\r3.\tShow her the evidence: If your mom is open to hearing more about the dangers of the substances she is considering using, try to provide her with evidence from credible sources. For example, you can show her research studies or articles from reputable medical organizations that demonstrate the risks of using these substances.\r4.\tEmphasize the importance of following her treatment plan: It's important for your mom to understand that her treatment plan has been carefully developed by her medical team to give her the best chance of a positive outcome. Emphasize the importance of following the treatment plan as recommended by her doctors.\r5.\tSeek support for yourself: Caring for a loved one with cancer can be emotionally and physically draining.

For context, here is the question related to the medical response:\n\n###Question: My mom [53F] has stage 4 breast cancer and is adamant on using dangerous substances to 'treat' herself Hello,\r\rMy mom was recently diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. Thankfully she has started treatment with oral medicine and will start Xgeva injections at her next visit, but she still says that she does not trust the doctors fully. During our first visit to the doctor she told him that she wanted to treat her cancer in a more \"natural way\". \r\rEarlier today she asked me for my paypal password, which i had no problem with. I didn't really question it, but I then got emailed receipts from purchases that she had made. She used my account to buy Black Slave and Sodium Chorite (which she will use to make MMS or a \"Miracle Mineral Supplement\"). The doctor had told us that her cancer was quite close to the skin and I am aware that she may have a skin lesion there, and i know she will be using Black Salve to 'cure' the skin lesion. I also searched up the \"miracle\" mineral supplement, and it is something that conspiracy theorists promote as an end all be all cure to seemingly every illness ranging from cancer and HIV to COVID-19 and the common flu. I have just contacted paypal to cancel the payments and I hope she never gets a hold of them.\r\rI have tried telling her and showing her images of how harmful these substances are to the human body but she doesn't believe me and just brushes me off and i don't know what to do.. Just now when i tried talking to her about why using these would be a bad idea, i noticed that she was reading something about MMS on her computer. I fear that as time goes by she will become more and more convinced of these alternate techniques, which could end badly. \r\rHow can i convince her to stop believing these things? What can i do?\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: There's probably nothing you can do, no magic combination of words you can use to convince her. \r\rGetting diagnosed with Stage IV cancer is a massive psychological trauma, it breaks a lot of people. Right now she is probably in a storm of emotions, and will latch onto any hope that is offered. I imagine her doctors aren't giving her very positive and hopeful outlooks and are probably telling her that there's no treatment that they can offer to save her life. Alternatively, there are stories on the internet filled with hope about MMS and other naturopathic/homeopathic remedies.\r\rPeople who have just been broken by a diagnosis like this often aren't using logic to make decisions, they use emotions. If you want to use a 5 Stages of Grief Model to help you understand what's going on, she's in the bargaining stage. She sees the hope and positivity on the internet and latches onto it because of course she will.\r\rThere's likely nothing you can do to change her thinking, she's not using logic to make these decisions, so logic is not going to make her stop. She just has to work through her grief until she comes to acceptance. You can try to fight it if you want, but you're not going to win. I'd suggest trying to minimize conflict and support her through this time as best you can, even though she's making emotional decisions. Do you want to remember this time as filled with fighting?\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

        "ChatGPT Response": "I understand that you may be feeling overwhelmed and confused about vaccines, especially with all the conflicting information and strong anti-vaccine views in your family. It's important to remember that vaccines are a proven and effective way to protect ourselves and others from serious and potentially life-threatening diseases.\rFirst of all, it's important to know that vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and evaluation before they are approved for use, and they are continuously monitored for safety once they are in use. The vast majority of people who receive vaccines experience no serious side effects, and any side effects that do occur are usually mild and go away quickly on their own.\rVaccines work by helping the body develop immunity to a particular disease. When you get a vaccine, your body produces an immune response to the vaccine, which helps it to recognize and fight off the disease if you are exposed to it in the future. This means that if you get vaccinated, you are less likely to get sick from a particular disease and, if you do get sick, your symptoms will likely be milder.\rIt's also important to consider the impact of vaccines on the wider community. When more people in a community are vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, which helps to protect those who are unable to receive certain vaccines due to age, underlying health conditions, or other factors. This is especially important for protecting vulnerable populations, such as young children, elderly people, and those with compromised immune systems.\rGiven the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is especially important to consider getting vaccinated against the virus. While it is true that some people who contract COVID-19 have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, the virus can be severe and even deadly for others, especially those who are older or have underlying health conditions. Getting vaccinated not only helps to protect you from getting sick, but it also helps to slow the spread of the virus and bring the pandemic under control.\rI understand that it can be difficult to make decisions about your health when you are feeling depressed, but I encourage you to consider seeking help for your depression and to take steps to take care of yourself. This might include seeking support from a mental health professional, talking to a trusted friend or family member, or finding healthy ways to manage your stress and emotions.\rIn terms of getting vaccinated, it's important to remember that you are an adult now and have the right to make decisions about your own health. You can talk to a healthcare provider or visit a vaccination center to learn more about the vaccines that are available to you and to get the information and support you need to make an informed decision.",

Since 2020 I've been bombarded with conflicting information and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.\r\rI've gotten sick a couple times over the past 2 years, and I've done many covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother.\r\rA few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.\r\rEvery person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild.\r\rEvery time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.\r\rI know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment and it's hard to detach from it.\r\rBefore, during and after the lockdowns I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and non caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally.\r\rI've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't worth it, especially considering that I have no clue where to get the vaccine, if I should get all of the other ones that my mother hasn't given me and a bunch of other stuff.\r\rMy depression prevents me for doing anything that takes a bit of effort so I'm asking you to please convince me that I need to get the vaccine.\r\rI'm in Italy, and I haven't heard about covid cases and vaccines in many months now.

Here are a few recommendations that may help:\r\rKeep the wound clean and covered: It's important to keep the wound clean and covered to prevent infection and further injury. You can use a liquid bandage or a finger-shaped gauze to cover the stitches, and secure it in place with tape such as kino tape.\r\rAvoid activities that put a lot of strain on the stitches: While it's okay to do some light training, it's important to avoid activities that put a lot of strain on the stitches. This might include activities that involve gripping or gripping heavy objects, as well as activities that cause sweating, as this can loosen the tape or gauze and expose the stitches.\r\rUse padding: If you need to do activities that involve gripping or using your injured finger, you can try using padding around the finger to provide some protection for the stitches. You can use foam or a soft material to pad the finger, and secure it in place with tape.\r\rTalk to your doctor: If you're unsure about what activities are safe to do with your stitches, it's always a good idea to talk to your doctor.

It results from the retina not getting enough blood flow for a short period of time (the ophthalmic artery is the first to branch from the internal carotid artery and also has collateral flow from the external carotid in some people) and can be considered a stroke symptom, making it a TIA (transient ischemic attack: basically pre-stroke). Though since you're young, I wouldn't put a stenotic ICA or CCA on the top of my list as the \"sudden, short and quickly recovered loss of vision\" is more commonly a result of your blood pressure being too low for a short period of time. In other words your heart couldn't keep up to your brains oxygen (blood flow) needs for a short while but eventually adjusted, just a little bit late. If the symptom repeats, I would (if I were to see you as a patient in clinic or maybe the ER) refer you to a cardiologist and maybe also consider a brain vessel imaging (a CTA or MRA, whichever is preferred). Considering your history, dehydration may have exacerbated the issue so try to stay hydrated. A syncope event itself is mostly okay as blood flow to the brain is usually immediately recovered but falling down and hitting your head on something like concrete may not.\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

Hi there, I've been noticing some strange things with myself lately, and doing a quick search online lead me to suggestions that I might have colon cancer.

Here's  what's been going on though, and apologies for TMI. \r\r3 or maybe 4 months ago, I noticed that I was pooping less frequently. My diets not the best (cheap junk food and bad balance in general), so I'm no stranger to constipation. So it wasn't anything new. When I was pooping though, and still to this day, the smell is this sickening weird death smell that I haven't had before until now, and the same thing for passing gas. No blood though, or any serious stomach pains which I read is a possible symptom of colon cancer. \r\rThis smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere? Besides this though, I've been feeling more tired than normal. I'm an avid coffee drinker so I tried more coffee and that didn't help. No coffee at all, and I felt exactly the same somehow. I'll take a nap and wake up tired. Thought it could be vitamin deficiency but I'm always outside and taking b12s and all that. \r\rIdk.

I (26F)had an ultrasound yesterday for a rock hard (yet moveable) lymph node in my neck. It\u0089\u00db\u00aas been there for about 2.5 years, I\u0089\u00db\u00aad say it grew a lot over the last 1.5 years. No pain. I\u0089\u00db\u00aam tired allllllllll the time. Absolutely exhausted. But that\u0089\u00db\u00aas pretty much it. It\u0089\u00db\u00aas right where my jaw meets my neck. Then I have a few other pea sized lymph nodes around my neck and trap muscle etc. I\u0089\u00db\u00aam freaking out, won\u0089\u00db\u00aat hear back from my doctor probably until mid next week. Does this sound like something I should be worried about? The report said \u0089\u00db\u00cfnormal appearing\u0089\u00db\u009d but the 17mm part scared me. I know I should\u0089\u00db\u00aave pushed for imaging sooner.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Nodes can be all sorts of sizes and submandibular nodes can be normal generally close to the range you are describing. The ultrasound images are more important to me than the actual report, although it's encouraging to hear that it is normal appearing. There's a number of ways to approach this. Since it's been there for 2.5 years, it is likely something that's benign. You can easily argue though that if it grew (I'm not sure how it could have grown a lot as it's not that large) that it may be best to take a biopsy of it just to be sure. Either way, this isn't something I'd lose sleep for over the weekend.\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

Prolapsed hemorrhoids are a type of internal hemorrhoid that has protruded through the anus and become visible outside the body. They can be painful and uncomfortable, and treatment may be necessary to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.\r\rTo drain a prolapsed hemorrhoid, a healthcare provider will typically perform a procedure called a hemorrhoidectomy. This involves removing the prolapsed hemorrhoid tissue through a surgical incision. The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the area around the anus so you don't feel pain during the procedure.\r\rIt's normal to feel anxious about having a surgical procedure, especially if you have chronic pain and other health conditions. It might be helpful to talk with your healthcare provider about your concerns and ask any questions you have about the procedure. They should be able to provide you with more information about what to expect and how to prepare for the procedure.\r\rIf you're experiencing back pain or stomach pain that is new and unrelated to your hemorrhoid, you should mention this to your healthcare provider.

For context, here is the question related to the medical response:\n\n###Question: Pregnancy: Abnormal 12 Weeks Ultrasound My (34 F) doctor just called me to inform me about a prenatal ultrasound I had done 2 days ago.\r\rI'm currently 12 weeks, I already had another ultrasound at 8 weeks and everything seemed normal. No issues with the pregnancy so far either.\rThis additional ultrasound was performed because my doctor told me this pregnancy is considered a \"geriatric pregnancy\".\rThe technician kept switching the transducer (?) and tried to get the baby to move more to be able to take better pictures. (\"The baby is not cooperative\" was what she said.)\rBaby was moving and normal heartbeat was measured. Technician printed pictures for me and congratulated me on the pregnancy.\r\rWhen my OBGYN called today he told me that unfortunately something seems to be wrong with the baby, and asked if I already heard anything from the technician who did the ultrasound (I told him I did not).\r\rHe couldn't tell me what medical condition it was, he said that he had never seen this before, the only thing he could tell me was that we need another ultrasound next week to confirm, and that genetic specialists might have to talk to me.\rHe said that there might have been something wrong with the ultrasound machine, but he sounded so negative on the phone that it made me feel like this pregnancy won't be able to continue. \r\rWhen I asked him to be more specific, he mentioned the following\r- Cavum Septum Pellucidum (CSP) not seen\r- Nasal Bone absent\r- Brain is normal size but couldn't see a cerebellum\r\rI googled the CSP and found sites that mentioned it would be difficult to locate before 18 weeks.\r\rI'm devastated right now and find it difficult being left with this information and having to wait for another week, that's why I'm seeking for advise here.\r\rHow likely is it that the technician just did a bad job or the ultrasound was not clear enough at 12 weeks, especially considering that so many features seem to be absent on the ultrasound? If the features are absent on the next ultrasound, what genetic disorder does this indicate and should I come to terms with the fact that this pregnancy most likely has to be terminated?\rAnything experienced something similar before? \r\rUltrasound image \r\rThank you for your help.\r\rEdit: Thank you for all your input so far.\r\rI have asked for the report and it was sent to me.\r\rThese are the things mentioned as abnormal:\r\r\"Choroid/skull: Abnormal. Head has a rounded appearance. Chloroid plexus appears abnormal. No cerebellum seen. Cavum septum pellucidum not identified.\rAbdominal wall/cord insertion: Abnormal. Omphalocele likely containing bowel just to the left of the cord insertion. Overall size measures approximately 8mm. There appears to be incomplete separation of the hemispheres with an apparent cortical defect.\"\r\rEverything else is listed as normal and nasal bone mentioned as identified; but then at the bottom of the report it sums up:\r\r\"Impression:\rSingle live fetus at 11 weeks 6 days.\rAbnormal appearance head, cerebrum and cerebellum.\rAbsent nasal bone. Omphalocele.\"\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: The ultrasound that is performed around 11-13 weeks of pregnancy is very important in order to detect certain abnormalities that can be seen early in pregnancy. The one image you have provided does not help a lot. However, absent nasal septum can be a worrying sign, although not always indicative of an actual problem with the fetus since it can be seen later in pregnancy. I have seen mothers with small noses have fetuses that looked like that on ultrasound but were born completely normal. Regarding the brain abnormalities, some cannot be seen clearly so early in pregnancy and some can be corrected later on. If absence of cerebellum is confirmed however, it can turn out to be a very serious condition for the newborn and can lead to severe developmental delay and neurological problems later in life. \r\rYou should for sure have another ultrasound by a specialist in that field. You might need also further testing, e.g. amniocentesis to confirm. I don't want to sound extremely alarming but you should also think about the possibility of terminating such a pregnancy if severe abnormalities are confirmed. \r\rExcuse the maybe not so great use of the language but English is not my native language. If you need more clarification feel free to ask. Best of luck to you.\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

The results of the holter monitor test are typically analyzed by a healthcare professional, such as a cardiologist, to determine whether there are any abnormalities in the rhythm or functioning of your heart.\r\rIn your case, the conclusion of the holter monitor test indicates that you have a normal sinus rhythm, which means that the electrical signals that coordinate your heartbeats are coming from the sinoatrial (SA) node, the natural pacemaker of the heart, and are happening at a normal rate. The results also indicate that you have rare supraventricular ectopic activity, which means that you have occasional extra heartbeats that originate from the atria or the atrioventricular (AV) node, rather than from the SA node. These extra heartbeats are also known as premature atrial contractions (PACs). PACs are relatively common and are usually not a cause for concern. They may be triggered by factors such as caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, stress, or lack of sleep, but they can also occur in people who are otherwise healthy.\r\rThe results also show that you do not have any ventricular ectopic activity, which means that you do not have any extra heartbeats originating from the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart. This is good news, as ventricular ectopic activity can be a sign of a more serious heart condition.\r\rFinally, the results indicate that your symptoms did not correlate with any dysrhythmia, which means that any symptoms you were experiencing, such as palpitations or shortness of breath, did not appear to be related to any abnormal heart rhythm.\r\rIn summary, the results of your holter monitor test indicate that you have a normal sinus rhythm and that you have rare supraventricular ectopic activity, which is not uncommon and is usually not a cause for concern.

Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of fainting, and it is typically triggered by a specific event or condition, such as standing for a long time, seeing blood, or experiencing emotional stress. Seizures, on the other hand, are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and can manifest in a variety of ways, including convulsions, loss of consciousness, and loss of bladder control.\r\rGiven that you have a history of fainting during blood draws, your primary care doctor may have assumed that your episode was vasovagal syncope.

It is important to rule out other potential causes, such as a cardiac or neurological issue, in order to determine the most appropriate treatment.\r\rI would recommend following the recommendations of the ER doctor and undergoing the recommended workups, such as a neurological and cardiac evaluation.

        "ChatGPT Response": "It sounds like you have been experiencing a number of concerning symptoms, including fainting episodes, vertigo, and difficulty speaking and moving after waking up. It is important that you continue to follow up with your healthcare provider to address these issues and determine the cause.\r\rBased on the information you provided, it sounds like your healthcare provider has already ruled out epilepsy as the cause of your fainting episodes and has instead diagnosed you with vasovagal syncope and possibly POTS syndrome. Vasovagal syncope is a type of fainting that occurs when the body overreacts to certain triggers, such as standing for a long time or experiencing strong emotions, and the heart rate and blood pressure drop suddenly. POTS syndrome is a condition in which the heart rate increases significantly upon standing up, leading to symptoms such as lightheadedness, fainting, and fatigue.\r\rIn addition to your EEG, which is a test that measures brain activity, there may be other tests that your healthcare provider may recommend to further evaluate your symptoms and determine the cause. For example, they may recommend a tilt table test, which is a test that helps to determine if your fainting episodes are due to a problem with the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. They may also recommend other tests such as an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, or a Holter monitor, which is a device that records heart activity for a period of time.\r\rIt is also important to consider whether there are any triggers or factors that may be contributing to your fainting episodes. For example, if you have been experiencing vertigo, it may be helpful to avoid activities that may exacerbate this symptom, such as looking up or down for a long time or standing for extended periods of time. If you have been diagnosed with POTS syndrome, your healthcare provider may recommend lifestyle modifications such as increasing your fluid and salt intake, avoiding prolonged standing or sitting, and avoiding certain medications that may worsen your symptoms.\r\rIn the meantime, it is important that you take care of yourself and prioritize your health.

[23F, Hispanic, 131 lbs, recently diagnosed with vertigo, Vasovagal syncope, and possibly POTS Syndrome, primary issue has happened over the course of the past week or so]\r\rSo, I\u0089\u00db\u00aam feeling very overwhelmed here. I\u0089\u00db\u00aave never been diagnosed with epilepsy. I\u0089\u00db\u00aave had doctors toss around the idea of \u0089\u00db\u00cfabsence seizures\u0089\u00db\u009d when I would have spells of zoning out over the past few years. I also used to faint randomly. That stopped for a few years. \r\rFast forward to this week, I\u0089\u00db\u00aam having issues again; but worse-\r\rMonday: I went to the ER because I\u0089\u00db\u00aave been getting some messed up vertigo symptoms. I felt very off. They told me the vertigo was related to my bp &amp; hr dropping and going up upon position changes (think they mentioned POTS?)\r\rTuesday night: I pass out at home after feeling light headed for a while. \rThis time (unlike times in previous years) I am out, unconscious on the floor. When I wake up I get told my eyes were fluttering and I wasn\u0089\u00db\u00aat responding. I was out maybe 3 minutes. I still had trouble speaking after waking up.\r\rWednesday morning: I got to work, my head was killing me in one specific spot in the back of my head for a few hours. Pain started to get intense, started getting heart palpitations, light headed was returns- BOOM, hit the ground - unconscious yet again. One of my co-workers found me, I wasn\u0089\u00db\u00aat responding and I was randomly twitching. My eyes were open but fluttering again. He called an ambulance and once the medics got there (literally within 2 minutes) they tried to wake me up but I wasn\u0089\u00db\u00aat responding still. I was in and out by this point but I couldn\u0089\u00db\u00aat speak or move. I heard him say my eyes were all over the place, next thing I knew he was digging his knuckles into my sternum and that mostly got me conscious again. When I opened my eyes I was dead confused and felt like I was about to slip out again. They brought me to the hospital and the doctor was ready to chalk it up to a migraine until it happened again while she was right next to me. \rThen she decided I needed to be seen by neurology and I was admitted. \r\rWhile I waited a few hours for neurology, the nurses noticed my eyes, tried to wake me up but I was again unable to speak or move. More knuckles into my sternum.\rThey got a rush order for an EEG (still took a few hours to get) but they only did it for about 35 mins and that was with breaks because I had to keep using the bathroom. Once the test was done and read- they said it came back normal and that it was not seizures. I was told it was Vasovagal syncope + vertigo and potentially POTS Syndrome. \r\rFriday: took day off from work to rest as I felt off still. \r\rToday at work: started to get odd sensation in back of my head like a tickle or skin crawling feeling almost that moved into back of my neck. Started to feel a bit of twitchiness. Feeling got more intense in my head and I felt myself checking out again. My co worker made sure I was safe and tried to wake me up. He said my eyes again were all over the place and fluttery, and this time I was super twitchy. He had to give me a few minutes after I was awake again because I still couldn\u0089\u00db\u00aat speak right after.  \r\rI just got a notification that the EEG report posted to my portal so I looked at it (even though I am aware I was told it was normal). I read it, it says \u0089\u00db\u00cfNo epileptiform abnormalities are appreciated\u0089\u00db\u009d(I.e-normal), but in the beginning of the report it\u0089\u00db\u00aas says \u0089\u00db\u00cfsubsequently witnessed to have episode of R head turn and unresponsiveness c/f seizure.\u0089\u00db\u009d \r\rI know I\u0089\u00db\u00aam not a doctor, I have no clue about any of this, but I feel like I need medication.

Now what?\r\rLast night around 9:30 pm I (19 F, 5\u0089\u00db\u00aa2, 132lb) developed a sharp pain in my lower left rib. It then became widespread and super hard to pin point. It was on the bottom, the top, multiple places at once. And a very tight spot in the exact middle of my chest. It started off small sharp pains intermittently. Then became overwhelming and I couldn\u0089\u00db\u00aat breathe too deep or it would hurt beyond words. Over the next hour it became increasingly more intense. I was simply sitting in bed and I could not get it to calm down. Then around 11:45 pm, I was trying to sleep but it hurt worse to lay down. It became unbearable, it radiated up my neck and into my face. My lower left jaw hurt to move and it was tight around my left cheek. I developed a headache but still didn\u0089\u00db\u00aat think much of it because for the past week I had been dealing with my face going numb on my left side. By this point my boyfriend was freaking out because I was gasping and shaking. It hurt too much to cry. He started googling things and told me he thinks I\u0089\u00db\u00aam having a heart attack. I told him no way, I\u0089\u00db\u00aam only 19. He kept telling me we needed to go to the hospital. But I\u0089\u00db\u00aall admit, I\u0089\u00db\u00aam stubborn. I have medical trauma and just convinced it was a very strange panic attack. I could have swore this was just caused by some other health issue I have (I have Asthma, Arthritis, and Celiacs Disease) It finally cooled down around 1am and I was okay enough to lay down and sleep. But he keeps persisting that I could have had a \u0089\u00db\u00cfsilent\u0089\u00db\u009d heart attack. That we should have went to the hospital, I could have d*ed, etc. I\u0089\u00db\u00aam at work today and I still don\u0089\u00db\u00aat feel the best and he\u0089\u00db\u00aas asking me to go to the hospital. I don\u0089\u00db\u00aat have a doctor where I live right now and the E.R doctors are just gonna dismiss it because I\u0089\u00db\u00aam a 19 year old female.

When I was 6, my doctors discovered a large AVM (arteriovenous malformation) in my brain. They did three bouts of gamma knife radiation and got rid of a lot of it, though not all. It's still large, but stable. However, from the radiation, I had a blood vessel collapse. This gave me a stroke in which I have partial paralysis on my right side. \r\rThrough my adolescent years, I went to both physical and occupational therapy. They saw improvement, but with me being a kid/preteen/teenager, I wouldn't really do exercises at home,  therefore the improvement that they saw pretty much faded. \r\rNow, in my 30s, I've pretty much given up on my right side. I can still feel on that side. I can walk, but with a limp. My arm is bent up and barely able to straighten. My fingers are always closed. They get tighter and my arm bends even more when I'm stressed. I have two little kids and a husband to care for and a part time job at a daycare. I finally started getting SSDI a few years ago. I've tried therapy a few times but it seems to barely help, especially considering how it helped before. I've greatly adapted to using only one hand for everything possible and it infuriates me when I have to admit that I need help with something that anyone else can do. \r\rWould I be a possible candidate for a prosthetic arm and hand? I'm so terrified that everything I do with just my left hand will cause it to wear out quicker than average. And just the thought of being able to finally use my right hand -- open the door, hold the steering wheel, even just scratch an itch while I browse my phone. It's an amazing feeling, but I don't want to get ahead of myself just to be disappointed. Of course I'm not going to go into this immediately. I'm going to do a pros and cons list, talk to my neurologist when I visit him in December, etc. But right now, I just want to know: would this be an option for me?\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Are you talking about an amputation and replacement of your arm with a prosthesis?

Caudal and SI joint injections haven't helped. PT hasn't helped, nor have muscle relaxants or analgesics.

Precum, also known as pre-ejaculate, is a clear, sticky fluid that is produced by the penis during sexual arousal and can contain sperm. While it is less likely to contain sperm than ejaculate, it is still possible for precum to transmit sperm and cause pregnancy.\r\rGiven the information you provided, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of pregnancy in your situation. The best way to determine if your girlfriend is pregnant is for her to take a pregnancy test or see a healthcare provider for a confirmatory test. It is also important to note that pregnancy is not the only reason for a missed period, and there could be other factors at play. It is always a good idea for both partners to be aware of the potential risks and to use appropriate methods of contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy.",

For 2-3 years now i have had a very low pulse imo. In the beginnig of this i didnt eat much and i went from 86kg down to 55kg, because of health anxiety. Im much better now. Im not super athletic at all, i only go for 1-2 walks a day for 1 hour +. I dont work atm and im usually at home. Last BP was 130/66. I had 2 ECGs in july, they were good. \r\rSo, i can have a full blown panick attack and my pulse will still be like 46-60 and i breathe very slow, feels like i cant \"normally\" breathe faster. My pulse increases when i stand and when i walk etc and ive had like 166 when walking up a hill, i never get tired, and i walk fast. \r\rPeak Flow Meter is 500-600 and my Spo2 is always 97-99%. The problem is that it just feels so weak and slow when im wide awake and have panick attacks, shouldnt it go up when im like that, and hyperventilate? Im the complete opposite. My doc told me its alright, i have been there several times, and my heart and lungs sounds fine. She told me that i had no need to go to a cardiologist unless i started passing out occasionally etc. \r\rWhy is it like this? Am i just in better shape then i think? The anxiety one is just weird for me. I have GERD and alot of muscle tension throughout my body. Im usually not dizzy when i have low pulse, i feel alright, just scared and anxious about it. Been hard to breathe these 3 years but always normal Spo2. \r\rDont know what more info could be relevant.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Young, relatively healthy people commonly have low resting heart rates.

So I was hospitalized two weeks ago for sudden and first time PSVT post COVID \u0089\u00db\u00d3 had a complete cardiac work up and 2 day admission to tele which showed no further arrhythmia. Echo was normal EJ 55-60%. \r\rI was sent back to ER yesterday after a couple days of leg pain and being winded, doc wanted to rule out clots after bed rest. They did an ultrasound on leg which was normal, and a D Dimer with results of &lt;150 ng/mL. Troponin draw was 0.000 (on admission 2 weeks ago it was 0.051 after the arrhythmia which was sustained 15 mins prior to self resolution, after ice water on my face). Told this all but rules out any clots, but don\u0089\u00db\u00aat understand the way it is expressed in numbers?\r\rWhat does this value of D Dimer mean ?

I am seeing an EP Cardiologist soon for possible further tests and Holter as well.\r\rThank you kindly in advance !\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: D-dimer is a byproduct of clot formation, so anytime a clot forms some d-dimer will form as well. The bigger the clot the more the d-dimer. Naturally the body is constantly forming clots from microtrauma to blood vessels due to normal wear and tear. But also after getting an injury, like blood drawn for lab work. Ultimately that means that you will always have some d-dimer amount in your blood. Which is what makes it a horrible test in most applications, very sensitive to almost anything and very not specific to almost anything.\r\rTroponin is a protein that is part of muscle, in your case they were looking for cardiac troponin (from the heart). It is only supposed to be in the heart muscle cells. If any of it is in the blood that means there was heart muscle breakdown and the troponin \"leaked\" into the blood from within the muscle cells of the heart. The more heart muscle damage, the higher the troponin level. So ideally you should have none in your blood.\r\rThis is an oversimplification but the gist of it.\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

However, it's important to try to determine the cause of the bleeding so that it can be treated appropriately. Bleeding from the rectum or anus can have many different causes, some of which may be serious.\r\rThere are a few common causes of rectal bleeding that might be worth considering:\r\rHemorrhoids: Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus and rectum. They can cause itching, discomfort, and bleeding. Hemorrhoids are often caused by straining during bowel movements, sitting for long periods of time, or constipation.\r\rAnal fissures: Anal fissures are small tears in the skin around the anus. They can cause pain and bleeding, especially during bowel movements. Anal fissures are often caused by constipation or passing large or hard stools.\r\rInflammatory bowel disease: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of conditions that cause inflammation in the digestive tract. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two types of IBD.

It's normal for a scar to be more noticeable immediately after surgery, and it can take several months for a scar to mature and become less noticeable. There are a few factors that can influence the appearance of a scar, including your age, genetics, and the location of the scar.\r\rThere are a few things you can do to help your scar heal and mature:\r\rKeep the area clean and dry. Gently wash the area with soap and water, and pat it dry.\r\rUse silicone sheets or gels. These products can help reduce the appearance of scars by keeping the area moisturized and protected from the sun.\r\rMassage the area. Gently massaging the scar can help soften and smooth it.\r\rUse sunscreen. Sun exposure can cause scars to become darker, so it's important to use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 when the scar is exposed to the sun.\r\rIt's also important to follow the post-surgery instructions provided by your surgeon.

Smelling salts, also known as ammonia inhalants, are used to stimulate the body and increase alertness in people who have fainted or are unconscious. However, they are not meant to be used as a regular method of waking up and can have negative side effects if used too frequently.\r\rThere are several other, safer methods you can try to help you wake up on time and feel more alert during the day:\r\rGet plenty of sleep: Make sure you are getting enough sleep at night to help you feel rested and alert during the day. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\r\rPractice good sleep hygiene: Establish a consistent bedtime routine and create a sleep-friendly environment (e.g., keep the bedroom cool, dark, and quiet). Avoid screens and caffeine close to bedtime.\r\rUse an alarm clock: Set an alarm clock to wake you up at the same time each day, and place it across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.\r\rGet some sunlight: Expose yourself to natural light as soon as you wake up to help regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\r\rExercise: Regular physical activity can help you sleep better and feel more alert during the day.\r\rEat a healthy diet: A balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, and protein can help you stay energized and focused.\r\rIf you continue to have trouble waking up and staying alert despite trying these strategies, it may be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and advice.",

Taking Prozac 20mg, Wellbutrin 150mg, Propranolol prn. In 2013 (age 35) I got a cochlear implant in my right ear. All was going well until I started having facial twitching when wearing the device and shocks inside my head. After some back and forth with my clinic I decided to just stop using it and move on. \r\rSince then I\u0089\u00db\u00aave had the following symptoms slowly grow worse or become more consistent. I\u0089\u00db\u00aave been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, slightly enlarged left thyroid, generalized fatigue/hypersomnia. I saw an ENT in Nov 2021 who felt a lump on the right side of my neck and had a CT done. My complaints and reason for seeing the ENT included headaches, neck pain, very visible asymmetrical swelling on my right neck/jawline, mild swallowing difficulties/chronic cough (I\u0089\u00db\u00aave had a cough since 2019). These were the findings:\r\r2021 FINDINGS: No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the right parotid gland. No definite evidence of disproportionate enhancement, radiopaque calculi or ductal dilatation to the parotid gland on the right. Submandibular glands, muscles of mastication, tongue, floor of mouth, pharynx, larynx appear unremarkable. No definite enlarged lymph nodes within the neck. Few phleboliths noted within the palatine tonsils. Asymmetry in the size of the thyroid glands with the right appearing larger than the left. No definite CT evidence of a discrete nodule within the thyroid. Streak artifact coursing through the thyroid from the patient shoulders. Nasal septum deviated to the right with a prominent spur abutting the inferior turbinate. Paranasal sinuses appear unopacified. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity incompletely seen on this study. Partial opacification of the remaining inferior mastoid air cells. Prominent degenerative changes within the cervical spine most pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7. Mild to moderate neural foramina narrowing on the right  at C5-C6.\r\rIMPRESSION:\r1. No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the parotid gland.\r2. Mild nonspecific enlargement of the thyroid on the right relative to the left.\r3. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity.\r\r_____________\rMy ENT wrote \u0089\u00db\u00cfno discreet mass was noted. I think it was fullness of the SCM in that area you are feeling. Have a nice day!\u0089\u00db\u009d The doctor then rejected my request for a follow up appointment. I didn\u0089\u00db\u00aat feel a lump, she did! I went in for neck pain and headaches and she found the lump. \r\rI wrote down everything I\u0089\u00db\u00aave complained about in the last five years and finally made the connection this was all probably due to cochlear implant failure/migration. I don\u0089\u00db\u00aat see the doctor frequently (why bother?) but when I do they give me more antidepressants. I had bad anxiety for awhile in 2020, but have no emotional or cognitive complaints. \r\rAfter a month and 11 follow up calls I finally got an appointment to begin the removal process at Mayo Clinic, where it was implanted. I am also having a sleep study done in November. I had a home one done and have mild apnea (6 incidents per hour) that shouldn\u0089\u00db\u00aat be making me fatigued/hypersomniac. \r\rI need someone to review the big picture and let me know if I sound crazy. I want to know if all of this will go away with the explanation or if I\u0089\u00db\u00aam doomed to have a fat right jawline and neck for the rest of my life. I also want to know how mad I should be at my doctors. Thanks!\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Nothing you are experiencing is due to the cochlear implant, and it doesn't really sound like it failed. It isn't uncommon to have some stimulation of the facial nerve with the device. An audiologist fixes that by changing the electrode stimulations such that it doesn't do that. If there are zaps or other concerning things, an audiologist can interrogate it to determine what is going on. You may be perceiving facial stimulation as zaps. Either way, this wouldn't have anything to do with what you are experiencing in the neck. \r\rI don't know what's going on in the neck, the CT was unremarkable and your physician didn't seem to find anything that was concerning.

It is understandable that you are feeling distressed by this.\r\rOral thrush is a fungal infection caused by the yeast Candida. It typically appears as white, raised lesions on the tongue and inside of the cheeks. In some cases, it can cause difficulty swallowing, a loss of taste, or a burning sensation in the mouth.\r\rThere are a few potential reasons why your oral thrush has been difficult to treat. One possibility is that you have an underlying health condition that is making it harder for your body to fight off the infection. For example, people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV or cancer, may be more prone to developing persistent thrush. Additionally, certain medications, such as corticosteroids or antibiotics, can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the mouth and make it easier for Candida to grow.\r\rIt is also possible that you are dealing with a resistant strain of Candida. In this case, the usual treatment options may not be effective. In such cases, your healthcare provider may need to prescribe a different antifungal medication or use a combination of drugs to treat the infection.\r\rThere are a few things you can try to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. These include:\r\rRinsing your mouth with saltwater several times a day\rAvoiding sugary foods and drinks\rUsing a soft toothbrush and avoiding toothpaste with a strong flavor\rSucking on ice chips or popsicles to soothe a sore throat\rI recommend discussing your treatment options with your healthcare provider.

I am a 21 y/o (F) who was diagnosed with oral thrush back in May 2022 (however I noticed it a month prior, I wanna say?) &amp; have been getting treated for it ever since. I did a week long course of Diflucan first, followed by a week course of Fluconazole when that didn\u0089\u00db\u00aat work. Since that also failed, they then gave me another week of Fluconazole, mixed with Nystatin swish &amp; swallow. That did not work. Since then, I\u0089\u00db\u00aave done three rounds of Itraconazole (100mg, 2 pills) along with the Nystatin swish &amp; swallow. I still have oral thrush after these 10-ish treatments.

The Itraconazole has been the most effective, but as soon as it\u0089\u00db\u00aas almost completely gone, it pops right back up.

Obviously it depends on where exactly you are, and if you\u0089\u00db\u00aare in a very rural area, you might be out of luck.\r\rIf you can use your tablets to keep up the proper prophylactic dose until 1 1/2 weeks before returning, that might be a good option, because as far as I know the incubation period for malaria usually is around two weeks, so if you return and start feeling sick, you can get proper treatment at home. \r\rIf you are staying for a longer time, I would really recommend trying to find medication on location to replace what you gave away. Otherwise keeping the emergency dose is probably not a bad idea. There\u0089\u00db\u00aas always concerns about fake meds unfortunately, but in areas where Malaria is common, you should be possible to get the meds at a pharmacy.\r\rYou seem to be doing well with the whole preventative measures like mosquito netting, behavioural choices etc., so keep that up. Not getting stung/bitten is the best protection, and if you have spent some time down there, you probably have minimising exposure down well.\r\rI might not be on top of my malaria game, so if someone else could chime in, that be great.

It is possible that the medical technician used one of these methods to determine your respiration rate during your visit to the hematologist.\r\rIf the technician used a pulse oximeter to measure your respiration rate, it is possible that the device may have recorded an unusually high rate due to a variety of factors, such as the fact that you and the technician were engaged in conversation or the device was not placed correctly on your finger.

I have monitored by respiration rate in the past and believe that the correct number is far closer to 9 or 10 then 18.\r\rWhere did that number come from?  Is it a function of the automatic blood pressure device or the pulse oximeter?

Enemas can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can be particularly dangerous if you already have diarrhea. Additionally, enemas can disrupt the natural balance of your colon's bacteria, which can worsen both diarrhea and constipation. Instead of using an enema, it is generally more effective and safer to try to address the underlying cause of your symptoms.\r\rIf you are experiencing abdominal pain and both diarrhea and constipation, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider. They can help determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend the most appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try the following steps to help manage your symptoms:\r\rDrink plenty of fluids, such as water, broth, and electrolyte solutions, to help prevent dehydration. Avoid caffeinated and sugary beverages, as they can worsen diarrhea.\rEat a balanced diet that includes fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This can help regulate your bowel movements and ease constipation.\rTry taking over-the-counter medications, such as loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate, to help control diarrhea.\rAvoid foods and drinks that may irritate your digestive system, such as spicy or fatty foods, alcohol, and caffeine.\rAvoid straining during bowel movements, as this can worsen constipation and lead to other digestive problems.\rGet regular exercise and stay active, as this can help regulate your bowel movements.\rAgain, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider if your symptoms persist or worsen.

It is understandable that you are feeling anxious about this situation.\r\rIt is difficult to say whether it is likely or unlikely that you have an undiagnosed aortic coarctation based on the information you have provided. Aortic coarctation is a narrowing of the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. It can cause high blood pressure, cold feet, and numbness in the legs.

I'm 28. I'm actually freaking out. \r\rMy question is, does this seem unlikely? I was consistently checked up on until I was 18. My blood pressure wasn't \"High for my age\" until around 18 (Despite how I was never put on meds for it until now).\r\rI feel like maybe I'm being over paranoid, but I match too many of these symptoms. Pale legs, easily cold feet, as a side note laying down in certain ways makes the top of one of my legs go numb now. \r\rI suppose a second question: if this turns out to be what it is, are my next steps very optimistic?

I'm sorry you're going through this, must be difficult.\r\r&amp;#x200B;\r\rCould it be coarctation of the aorta? Maybe. I can't know without examining you thoroughly and without an ankle brachial index (BP comparison between ankle and bicep.) You would also need an echocardiogram to confirm it.\r\r&amp;#x200B;\r\rLet me answer the other question about the life expectancy. There is something you need to understand about life expectancy: It is a statistical figure.\r\rYOU are not a statistic. You are a real person with a real body that may or may not be similar to others. Not only that, but also the statistic you are pulling is for those who NEVER get treated. I don't like to tell patients their chances of survival or death based on averages. I prefer to tailor the discussion to the patient. From what you've said so far, it seems you have been mostly asymptomatic. The cause of morbidity and death for patients with this disease is development of hypertension, kidney disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic dissection, and heart failure. From what you've said so far, I can say you most likely have not developed any of those complications, however some lab tests and imaging need to be done to check for sure. Your condition can still be salvaged and your life expectancy prolonged. Yes I believe you do have \"optimistic\" chances.\r\rIF it is coarctation of the aorta, you will need more lab tests and imaging and you will be managed accordingly. I assure you though, you will not drop dead suddenly just because you have coarctation of the aorta, it usually leads to complications which you will definitely notice. Try not to think too much about it, once you have confirmation of diagnosis, then work up can start and management can proceed.\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

First, all smells seemed to be the same, like everything I smelled seems like beans or cigarrettes. \rA few months later I wasn't be capable of smell anything. the problem: COVID 19 started and no one was concerned about going to a doctor for \"little diseases\". \r\rFirst I thought that was a sinusitis crisis so I waited a while for the whole COVID thing passes and then I  go to a doctor. \rThe first one told me that probably the cause was the tobacco use. He prescribed me prednisolone and an CAT scan from the perinasal sinuses. \rThe prednisolone don't resolve at all my problems and I waited a long time for the next appointment because the doctor has left the hospital and they put me on a waiting list. \rMeanwhile I payed for a private specialist who prescribed me more prednisolone and didn't do or say anything important to help me. \r\rThe third and last doctor told me that probably was a virus that anyone could catch in a simple flu, and said that probably I would never get my smell sense back ever again because it's been a long time and my nerve is already so damaged that it doesn't recover anymore.\r\rRight now, I'm waiting a call from a septum deviation surgery (that will help me to breath better but no recovering my smell senses) and I'm a little bit lost here.\rI'm thinking that the cause could be the sinusitis, the tobacco, a random virus, some medication that have an side effect... or could be anything worse??? like an indicative of degenerative desease? Idk. I feel like the doctors don't discarted other causes and I'm just waiting to see what happens. Nothing, because I won't get able to smell anything in my life. \r\rAnd now I'm also losing my sense of taste too... I'm very worried. \r\rI need some medical advice, please _\u00d9\u00aa\u008f_\u00d9\u008f_\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: If there was sinusitis, the CT you had should have picked it up. It also would have likely picked up a number of other things that could cause smell loss. Otherwise viral causes would be the next most likely. There is smell retraining therapy which you can try. Essentially it involves intentional exposure to essential oils throughout the course of the day in an attempt to retrain the brain to smell appropriately\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

How do I make this better aside from getting away from her dog?\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Certainly can be allergies.

I was having the chest discomfort and all of a sudden, I couldn\u0089\u00db\u00aat breathe, my face went hot, I got extremely dizzy and my vision was going black as I was screaming for my mom to help me (she didn\u0089\u00db\u00aat hear me, so I\u0089\u00db\u00aam lucky I\u0089\u00db\u00aam alive). Anyways, that only lasted for 3-4 seconds and I came back to life and my heart started beating really fast as if the heart had to pump the blood fast. I now started measuring my blood pressure and it\u0089\u00db\u00aas low, while lying down, my blood pressure can be anything from normal 110/65, to 90/49, and Ill feel all ok, but as soon as I stand up, it goes up to 125/79. My heart rate while lying is 49-59, and standing can go up to 95. A few years ago I noticed when breathing in, my heart beats faster, when exhaling it beats slower, and when I do this while taking my BP, it shows an irregular heart beat symbol that flashes. This doesn\u0089\u00db\u00aat happen all the time as I\u0089\u00db\u00aam purposely taking deep breaths that triggers my heart to beat faster. I also need to mention that my heart has been listened to a few times by many doctors, and they have told me it\u0089\u00db\u00aas no heart murmur and it sounds normal, and two EKG that\u0089\u00db\u00aas normal, but I swear to God these EKG were taken in less than a minute, which was weird, and also one doctor told me I had some physiological arrhythmia but that could maybe be sinus arrhythmia?

My guess is that I have some kind of nerve damage or something.\r\rI also noticed the yellow thing a month before, but it was much, much smaller and it went away.\r\rOne other thing to add, I mostly take 10mg of zolpidem, but I took 20mg with other sedatives. I heard about zolpidem and the weird things it can do to you, but I took precautions, I was tired and I took quetiapine, hydroxyzine and 100mg trazodone.\r\rThis is all my guess, but I am not a professional.\r\rIf you need any more details feel free to ask me, thank you very much!\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: This looks like old bruising.

A few hours later I noticed if I applied pressure to the other side then it would also feel some pain, and the day i went to the ER I felt nausea, but I went to my regular doctor today and they tested my urine and said there is minor amounts of blood in it, though to me it looked like a normal yellow with no red, so the doctor think it's a UTI but they did not prescribe me anything for the pain and took my blood for lab testing, however I found out I might have to wait until Monday, and I'm afraid if its something more serious I could die. The pain is still persistent in my stomach, but I am unsure if the pain worsened much since then. But it does feel a bit sharper than earlier. I never had a fever while this was happening, I was mildly constipated a few times but was able to use bathroom normally a few times and pass gas. But it felt gurgly in the lower right area as well.

For context, here is the question related to the medical response:\n\n###Question: I'm a mom of 4 kids (ages 12, 11, 6, and 4). They're all fully vaccinated and always up-to-date on regular check-ups. \r\rMy 6-year-old, who I'll call J, is the only kiddo with any issues, and they've generally been mild. He has moderate asthma which is controlled with Flovent, but has otherwise been a healthy and active kid. \r\rBut recently, J has been getting sick a LOT. I just picked up his third prescription for antibiotics in 30 days, and he has had a fever for 6 days now that doesn't completely go away even with multiple fever reducers (it does go down enough that he's comfortable though). Yesterday I noticed he has swollen, bleeding gums and a few ulcer-like sores in the back of his throat which the doctor diagnosed as hand, foot, and mouth disease (no tests were done though). Today I brought him back in due to his fever spiking to 104.6 and him struggling to walk/move last night (also improved - but not completely fixed - with meds) and they did a strep test which came back positive.\r\rThe reason I'm really worried though is the weight loss and his medical record in general. I looked up his growth chart when I got home (I can access his records online) and he has grown 1.3 inches in the last 6 months but his weight dropped by 1 pound, causing his BMI to go from the 20th percentile to the 1st. \r\rI also looked at his blood work. They checked his hemoglobin at his 6-year checkup in July and that was low at 10, but they told me to just make sure he's eating iron (he eats a lot of iron-rich foods but doc said to just increase them). The last time he had a CBC was 5 years ago at his 1 year check-up but I looked at it anyway and his lymphocytes were high and neutrophils were low, but I don't think his doctor ever said anything about abnormal results so maybe that's not a concern? I didn't have online access at the time so I'm sure when they didn't call with results, I assumed they were normal.\r\rShould I have the doctor do a CBC if he keeps getting infections or not gaining weight/losing weight? Or should the doctor tell me if these things are concerning? I feel like a hypochondriac but I really just have a feeling something isn't right. :(\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Not likely to be something to stress over.\r\rThough it varies by your community/exposure risks, I have seen multiple cases between the hospital and clinic this last month with multiple viruses, back to back viruses, etc. It is not unreasonable that he was sick multiple times.\r\rThe fever is likely from whatever viral processes he had going on.  Outside of strep nothing sounds bacterial from what you\u0089\u00db\u00aave mentioned so I think 3 rounds of antibiotics was more appeasement or risk stratification than \u0089\u00db\u00cfappropriate\u0089\u00db\u009d treatment.  Without a known or suspected bacterial nidus, no reason for antibiotics.\r\rHe could have poorer dental hygiene with being sick, inflammation from infection, or it could be something like a vitamin C deficiency with the bleeding gums and recurrent infections.  Load him up with some emergenC.\r\rWeight loss is normal when being sick and I wouldn\u0089\u00db\u00aat even look at his weight again until he\u0089\u00db\u00aas been healthy for around 4-6 weeks with normal appetite.\r\rHFM is a clinical diagnosis, I wouldn\u0089\u00db\u00aat send you to get the $800+ PCR test to confirm it in just about any case, since the management wouldn\u0089\u00db\u00aat change.\r\rHis CBC 5 years ago is has virtually no relevance to his current state unless there was a pathological anomaly like leukemia found on the initial one.  I wouldn\u0089\u00db\u00aat even concern myself with mild anemia in 1-2 year olds at that level due to increased milk consumption and the body still ramping up production while growing rapidly.\r\rAt the end of the day nothing here is concerning for him being sick beyond seasonal illness but you should speak to your pediatrician about it in more detail so you feel comfortable that you\u0089\u00db\u00aave covered your bases if you\u0089\u00db\u00aare truly still worried.\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

Meds: omeprazole daily, famotidine prn, cetirizine daily. \r\rI had an abdominal/pelvic CT today for months long issue of epigastric pain radiating to the back. Endoscopy was normal, symptoms not relieved by PPIs or H2 blockers, hence the CT.\r\rMy question is regarding an incidental finding on the CT that the GI office did not bring up when they called me to discuss results. I only saw the complete report after getting off the phone.\r\rThere was nothing on the CT that could explain my GI symptoms, but under the \"Findings\" section for lower chest \"mild scarring/atelectasis\" is listed. No other description is given. However, these findings are left out of the \"Impressions\" section of the report. As I said, I'm a former smoker. I have also had pneumonia at least 3 times in my life with a bout back in April. I didn't have a chest x-ray until May, a couple of weeks later, and that read \"Impression: Peribronchial thickening consistent with bronchiolitis and/or reactive airway disease\". No one called me to discuss those particular results and I had mostly recovered from the pneumonia (I thought) so I just shrugged it off. Turns out that since that bout of pneumonia, I have a harder time catching my breath than I used to and it's even a bit painful sometimes depending on the level of strain.\r\rThe CT report is verbatim as follows:  \"Lower chest: mild scarring/atelectasis\"\r\r Can someone explain to me what this actually might mean for me clinically? Google U just screams \"COLLAPSED LUNG\" at me and that is not helpful. Is this something I need to be concerned about? What could be the cause? Can it be related to the findings on that x-ray? Should I get a pulmonology consult?\r\rI should add that I am changing insurance plans for the 2nd time in one year and the town I live in has a provider shortage and most of them are only accepting new OB patients. It has been difficult getting care because of this.\r\rThanks for the input.\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Atelectasis isn\u0089\u00db\u00aat an uncommon finding. It just means your lung in that area is not being inflated. It is indeed collapsed. This can be for any number of reason but for most it is due to lack of exercise or activity. It\u0089\u00db\u00aas also common in those with recurrent infections or get bronchitis because gunk builds up and blocks airways from getting proper aeration. Typically when you work your body, you tend to breath in harder which opens up all portions of your lungs. \r\rYour lungs are made up of tons of tiny little balloons (alveoli). The balloons at the bottom of your lung sometimes need extra force to really open them up. In your case, if you have scarring in that area, it may be even harder to inflate. Atelectasis is when the balloons collapse and haven\u0089\u00db\u00aat been opened up in some time. It looks like your lung tissue has shrunken but typically isn\u0089\u00db\u00aat a problem unless a large portion of your lung is affected. \r\rIf you\u0089\u00db\u00aave never tried one, a spirometer might be beneficial to help open up this portion of your lung. Guaifenesin to clear out mucus may also help. It can also be painful to open that portion of the lung up if atelectasis has been long standing.\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

The pain appeared after a game of bowling (I don't remember exactly how I got hurt because at the time I didn't feel any pain). At first I thought it was tendonitis, so I rested my wrist, but nothing helped: the pain persisted.\r\rThe pain is on the radial side of the wrist. To be precise, I would say that the pain is located in the synovial sheath at the level of the radial extensors. The pain is quite diffuse (from the extensor pollicis longus to the abductor pollicis longus), so it is complicated to determine a precise location of the pain.\r\rThe pain is always present to an acceptable degree but it intensifies when I pronate or flex my wrist, for example. Tennis is typically the kind of sport I can't do anymore because the pain is too intense.\r\rA few months ago I had an MRI scan but the radiologists didn't see anything abnormal. I think they must have looked wrong because when I did an ultrasound scan a few weeks later, they told me I had inflammation of the sheath and that an infiltration would solve the problem. The problem is that the cortisone infiltration (done on the radial extensors) that I did, didn't work. So now, I don't know who to believe and I don't know the cause of my pain. I think that maybe the problem is related to the nerves (radial or medial) and not to the tendons  but that's just a guess.\r\rIs there anyone here who could look at my MRI (I'll send you a video) because I'm sure they didn't look properly...\r\r&amp;#x200B;\r\rCheers !\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Sure sounds like tendonitis. Nerve pain in that area would generally not be exacerbated by moving the wrist, though pain with pronation could potentially point to nerve entrapment at the elbow. Any history of elbow injuries?\r\r The negative MRI is good news that there wasn't anything lurking at the wrist like a missed broken bone. Typically for tendinitis - or pain at the radial wrist for a variety of reasons - a [thumb spica splint]( and hand therapy will do the trick, and we only reach for cortisone injections if you've tried those and failed.\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

        "ChatGPT Response": "It's good that you have already had an ultrasound and that your liver enzymes and GFR have returned to normal ranges. However, it's understandable that you are still concerned about the persistent abdominal pain you have been experiencing.\r\rThere are many potential causes of abdominal pain, and it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further testing. It's possible that the pain you are experiencing is related to the c-section you had 8 months ago, but it could also be due to other factors. Some potential causes of abdominal pain include:\r\rMusculoskeletal issues, such as muscle strain or a hernia\rDigestive problems, such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\rInfections, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or an infection in the abdomen\rHormonal imbalances, such as those related to the menstrual cycle\rGallstones or kidney stones\rIt's important to continue working with your doctor to try to identify the cause of your abdominal pain. They may recommend further testing, such as a CT scan or an MRI, to help determine the cause of your symptoms. In the meantime, you can try to manage your pain by taking over-the-counter pain medication as needed, staying hydrated, and eating a healthy, balanced diet. It may also be helpful to try relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help manage your pain.",

I had a baby 8 months ago via c section and within a week of having her I started having this dull pain in my right abdomen between bottom of ribs and belly button. I\u0089\u00db\u00aave had ultrasound which came back normal. My liver enzymes were high but have made their way back to normal range as of a few months ago. GFR slightly declined between having baby and a few months ago but still in normal range. I continue to have this dull pain ( 2-3 on scale of 10) basically every day I might get lucky and go a day or two when I don\u0089\u00db\u00aat notice but I\u0089\u00db\u00aam worried there is something more going on internally but can\u0089\u00db\u00aat seem to get any more out of my Doctor. When standing and putting pressure on the area I swear I can feel a couple tiny lumps under the skin. Any suggestions?\n\nAnd here is the original response that needs to be more empathetic:\n\n###Answer: Could get a HIDA scan and get examined for an umbilical hernia\n\nPlease rephrase this response to significantly increase its empathy, making it more compassionate and understanding.

        "ChatGPT Response": "It is possible that you could be experiencing transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), also known as mini-strokes. TIAs are temporary episodes of stroke-like symptoms that resolve within 24 hours. They are caused by a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, just like a stroke, but the blockage is resolved before it causes lasting damage.\r\rThe symptoms you describe, such as numbness or tingling on one side of the face and limbs, could be consistent with a TIA. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis, as these symptoms could also be caused by other conditions.\r\rIt is also important to mention that the symptoms you describe could potentially be related to the other neurological conditions you are experiencing, such as dizziness, vertigo, and head pressure. It is important to continue working with your healthcare team to identify the cause of these symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.\r\rIn the meantime, it is important to take care of your general health by eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, as these factors can increase the risk of stroke and TIA.",
